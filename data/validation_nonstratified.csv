PMC3585139_P004,"The purpose of this study was to quantify the spatial variation in abundance of juvenile corals (≤50 mm) among three sectors of the Australian’s Great Barrier Reef that differ in their latitude (14° S, 18° S and 23° S) and to compare these patterns to spatial variation in abundance of parrotfishes. Scraping and excavating parrotfishes (f. Labridae), unlike roving herbivorous fishes from the Acanthuridae, Siganidae and Kyphosidae, remove parts of the underlying substratum when feeding. Consequently, incidental grazing by scraping and excavating parrotfishes may be an important source of mortality for recently settled and juvenile corals. Specifically, the abundance, composition, size, and orientation of juvenile coral assemblages were compared among sites (within reefs), among reefs, and among latitudinal locations, along the Australian’s Great Barrier Reef. Little is known about the juvenile life-stage of corals on natural substrata, thus this study provides important ecological data on early life-history of scleractinian corals at small and large scales.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,OTHER,,NA
PMC8237990_P003,"In addition of being a tractable model for genetic studies, schistosomes are also important human parasites. Three major schistosome parasite species (i.e. Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma japonicum) infect over 200 million people in 78 countries. These parasites have a complex lifecycle, involving a freshwater snail (intermediate host) and a mammal (definitive host). When parasite eggs are expelled with mammal feces or urine in freshwater, miracidia larvae hatch and actively search for its snail vector. Larvae penetrate the snail head-foot, differentiate into sporocysts that then asexually proliferate to generate daughter sporocysts. These actively consume snail tissue (hepatopancreas and ovotestis), castrating the host snail, and parasite sporocysts can comprise up to 60% of the tissue within infected Biomphalaria glabrata snails. The daughter sporocysts release cercariae, the mammal-infective larval stage of the parasite. Hundreds to thousands of these motile cercariae exit through the snail body wall and are released into freshwater. Exit through the body wall results in leakage of hemolymph and damage to the snail. This quantitative transmission and virulence related trait – numbers of cercariae produced from the intermediate snail host – is the focus of this paper.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,OTHER,,NA

PMC7065354_P021,"To better understand the etiology of complex diseases, the Koch’s first postulate should expand the definition of pathogen from the presence of single organism in all cases to the presence of microbial dysbiosis in all individuals. In other words, a dysbiotic microbiota should be found in similar composition in all diseased individuals. Some prior studies suggest that shrimp IM is strongly associated with developmental stage and environment, yet the IM structure and assembly patterns tend to be similar during disease progression. Consistently, decreased α-diversity and altered IM composition were detected in both fields (Fig. 1). It has been proposed that microbiota-targeted biomarkers serve as a powerful tool for disease diagnosis. The POD value successfully discriminated WFS from control by the optimal 167 OTUs markers (Fig. 1g), and further achieved accurate classification for distinguishing shrimps receiving IMT (Fig. 4c) and metabolite-supplements (Additional file 2: Figure S11) from control shrimp. Thus, WFS contribute a similar dysbiosis in the IM, irrespective the cause of disease. There are evidences that Vibrio, Candidatus Bacilloplasma, Aeromonas, and Photobacterium species are opportunistic pathogens for shrimp, which could cause gastrointestinal diseases. By contrast, Chitinibacter spp. have been applied as probiotics due to their capacity of chitin derivatives. Consistent with these findings, increased abundances of the former opportunistic pathogens and decreased abundance of the later probiotics were the common features associated with WFS shrimp. The divergent changes in these populations might contribute the observation that a decline of pathways conferring lipoic acid metabolism and mineral absorption in WFS. This pattern was consistent with a previous study that lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism were retarded in WFS shrimp. In addition, the enrichment of bacterial chemotaxis and flagellar assembly pathways hint at pathogens growth and infectious diseases development, which were found in WFS shrimp (Additional file 2: Figure S4b). Indeed, the IM functional alterations were frequently linked to shrimp disease. Meanwhile, some sorts of metabolites, especially lipids and organic acids, were found to be related to the IM alteration in WFS (Additional file 2: Figure S5). It is worth to emphasize that the dietary supplemented metabolites ultimately altered the microbial composition and diversity. Similarly, it has been proved that lipids exert an effect on the IM composition and diversity in shrimp. Here, the integration of multiomics advanced the identification of key features in the IM and WFS. That is, WFS-associated dysbiosis in the IM led to the aberration of metabolites, which was validated by metabolite-supplements, resulting in similar IM and shrimp disease signs (Fig. 2c, Additional file 2: Figure S11). Collectively, these findings demonstrate common characterization, such as dysbiotic IM and its mediated functions, which were universal in WFS shrimp.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,OTHER,,NA
PMC6509379_P019,"In contrast with females, males have larger claws during the reproductive season than the nonreproductive season. Differential investment in larger weaponry during the reproductive season could be advantageous if larger weapons lead to greater success in burrow (and female) defense. Larger weapons would seem an obvious advantage in competitive interactions, and indeed, for many crustaceans, crayfish, shore crabs, and female snapping shrimp, Alpheus heterochaelis), larger claws confer an advantage. Surprisingly, however, we lack direct evidence of a competitive advantage associated with larger claws in male snapping shrimp. Paired and unpaired males do not differ in residual claw size; in the congener Alpheus heterochaelis, body size (rather than claw size) predicts the winners of competitive interactions, and winners of competitive interactions do not differ from losers in residual claw size.

The flights of the bat and moth were recorded by high-speed cameras (MotionPro X3, Integrated Design Tools, Inc., Florida, USA) capturing frames per second, as well as a ch horizontal microphone array system with a sampling frequency of kHz. Based on the video recordings obtained from sessions of successful prey capture by bats, the flight paths of the bats and moths were reconstructed in the -dimensional space of the chamber. The average flight velocities of the bats and moths in the horizontal plane of the chamber were m/s and m/s, and therefore and in Equations 1 and 2 were assumed to be m/s and m/s, respectively. In addition, the horizontal angle at which the maximum sound pressure level of the pulses decayed by was rad from the pulse direction of the bats, so that was assumed to be rad. Regarding , experiments using several species of prey such as midges and caddisflies revealed the maximum echolocation distance by kHz ultrasound as about m. In our experiments, the dominant frequency emitted by the bats was kHz, and the wing span of the moths (–mm) was longer than that of the midges and caddisflies used in. Consequently, the sound pressure level of the echoes reflected from the prey in our experiments were likely larger than those reflected from the midges and caddisflies. Therefore, the bats (Rhinolphus derrumequinum nippon) could locate the moths (Goniocraspidum pryeri) far from m in our experiments, and then was assumed as the shortest echolocation range in the numerical simulation.

Distance to roads, which, if short, potentially raises the risk of roadkill, was of no importance either as regards nest-site selection by these owls. Again, nesting on trees which are located near roads is not likely to lead to collisions with vehicles because the birds fly to and from their nests at heights well above the traffic.

Indeed, at the time of our study, none of the households in Katchénou had sanitation and all of them obtained drinking water from a community pump. The nearest health center was situated in Sokrogbo, a village located approximately 5 km from Katchénou with difficult access particularly during the rainy season. The observation that remote rural setting (i.e., Katchénou) was significantly associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection in infants but not in school-aged children might be explained by the high malaria transmission in this setting, increasing the probability that young infants become infected. The high prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum in all the three study groups emphasizes the importance of implementing prevention and control measures against malaria. Among infants aged 6–23 months, 45% were infected with Plasmodium falciparum and the parasitemia level in this age group was higher than in children aged 6–8 years and in non-pregnant women aged 15–25 years.

PMC3125810_P001,"Bacteriophage, the viruses that infect bacteria, can typically be divided into two groups, lytic and temperate. Lytic phage infect propagate within and then lyse their host bacterial cells as part of their life cycle, while temperate phages may exist benignly within the DNA of their bacterial host. Temperate phages can physically integrate into one of the native replicons (plasmid or chromosome) of their preferred bacterial host, although a few phages can exist as independent plasmids. Integrated phages are termed prophages. Prophages tend to be inserted at specific integration sites within the host genome, but their location can vary depending on the phage species. Prophages are essentially dormant phages that are only replicated through bacterial DNA replication and cell division. Bacteria containing a prophage are called lysogens because their prophage is in the lysogenic cycle, in which the viral (esp. the lytic) genes are not expressed. Upon damage to the host cell DNA or other physiological cues, the prophage may be induced to excise itself from the bacterial genome. After induction, the phage's lytic genes are turned on, infectious virions are assembled within the host cell and the cell is lysed (killed) releasing infectious phage particles that can go on to infect more cells.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,OTHER,,NA

The majority of phage DNA fragments (prophages) already inserted into the bacterial host genome were defective in genes associated with the disruption of host cells, which could be explained by purifying selection of temperate phage after its integration into bacterial chromosome. Prophages within Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum tend to be inactive and unlike to enter lytic cycle spontaneously and release virions thereof. Notably, Acr protein and Aca protein encoding genes were found in the prophage from A13 strain presenting incomplete I-U system, which may represent a counter-defense strategy of temperate Bifidobacterium phage against CRISPR-Cas system.

PMC4702144_P003,"Penguins do not experience or feed on the average concentration of prey in their foraging domain, but rather use directed searching and different foraging behaviors to find rare, high concentrations of prey in the environment19. Therefore, to understand the marine environment as a penguin experiences it, it is necessary to sample on similar spatiotemporal scales of a foraging penguin. Traditional sampling methods using net tows or profiling equipment do not typically provide nearshore, concurrent, continuous, and high-resolution oceanographic data of multiple factors. However, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), travelling at similar speeds, depth ranges and endurance as a foraging penguin, can sample the dynamic marine environment as experienced by a penguin2021. These AUV’s navigate in nearshore coastal environments, and can simultaneously measure multiple trophic levels and physical properties of the water column. Near Palmer Station, congeneric Adélie and gentoo penguins are central place foragers and breed synchronously on nearby colonies during the austral summer. We focused on the chick-feeding phase of the breeding cycle when adults are provisioning chicks and parental foraging ranges of both species overlap. This period is a critical time for chick growth as fledglings with a higher body mass are more likely to survive22. We deployed an AUV informed by real-time positions of foraging penguins outfitted with satellite transmitters to measure the prey field and ocean properties.

PMC7138806_P015,"Following the moult period, guillemot DEE gradually increased across the subsequent winter months before reaching a non-breeding season peak in April, followed by similarly high values during the breeding season (Fig. 1). Seabird energy expenditure is high during reproduction and generally increases across the breeding period35. Here, increasing values of guillemot energy expenditure throughout the non-breeding period were largely driven by heightened flight activity (Fig. 4), associated with increased colony attendance (Fig. 3). Whilst they are well adapted for wing-propelled diving, flight is an energetically costly activity for guillemot species, with Brünnich’s guillemots Uria lomvia having the highest flight costs recorded for any vertebrate14. Contrastingly, in albatrosses flight is highly efficient because they are able to use winds to soar and glide, as opposed to engaging in the costly flapping flight utilised by auks36. Flight activity can therefore form high proportions of albatross time-activity budgets (e.g. 12.7 hours per day in incubating black‐browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys) and yet result in relatively low values of mass-specific DEE37. Guillemots, however, must adapt their behaviour and reduce their time spent flying in order to minimise its contribution to DEE. Guillemots from the Isle of May did reduce their flight activity from October to March, in comparison to the breeding season; it seems possible that the guillemots located productive North Sea foraging areas and stayed within these, likely making short commuting flights to optimal feeding patches, as opposed to extensive daily movements38. However, as the breeding season neared and birds became constrained to remaining in proximity to the colony to occupy and defend their breeding sites39, flight activity and the associated energetic costs increased (Fig. 4), leading to heightened DEE (Fig. 1). Indeed, guillemots are under central-place foraging constraints during the pre-breeding and breeding periods, undertaking longer flights than during the winter, commuting to and from the colony on a daily or near-daily basis, with detrimental consequences for their energy expenditure. Contrastingly, energetically advantageous lower thermoregulatory costs may be likely whilst birds are at the colony as they will be exposed to warmer air temperatures, lower conductivity and increased body heat conservation through sharing warmth with conspecifics40. Overall, Isle of May guillemots chose to return to the colony outside the breeding season, indicating that despite its associated energetic costs, this must have been a beneficial strategy that local resources were able to support.",guillemots,foraging areas,locate,unspecified,Uria aalge,Areas,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,FALSE,,NA
PMC6813443_P003,"Euprymna scolopes produces a single type of macrophage‐like hemocyte that can migrate between tissues, and bind and phagocytose bacteria both in vivo and in vitro. Hemocytes migrate into the light organ as early as 2 hr post‐hatching upon detection of tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), a monomer of peptidoglycan. Hemocytes are detected in the luminal spaces of both juvenile and adult light organs where they are thought to sample the bacterial contents, and release chitin that is metabolized by the symbiont in adult hosts. Several studies support the hypothesis that colonization of the light organ influences the maturation of hemocytes and the ability to recognize Vibrio fischeri. Using proteomics and transcriptomics, two studies identified innate immune proteins/genes that were differentially abundant/expressed in hemocytes isolated from wild‐caught sym animals as compared to animals that had been cured of Vibrio fischeri using antibiotics. A third study found that hemocytes from colonized adult hosts differentially bound various Vibrio species, adhering to five times more Vibrio fischeri cells when isolated from animals in which the light organ had been cured of the symbiont. Taken together, these studies suggest that colonization of the light organ initiates a maturation program that results in the hemocytes’ ability to recognize and differentially respond to the symbiont.

White clover mosaic virus (WCIMV) infection in Trifolium repens can decrease the attractiveness of white clover plants for female fungus gnats. In zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV)-infected Cucumis sativa, attraction of the cucumber beetle, which can transmit the bacterial wilt pathogen Erwinia tracheiphila, was reduced. In both cases, the production of volatile compounds altered due to virus infection and appeared to protect host plants by decreasing herbivore infestation rates. Thus, viruses clearly may have beneficial functions for plants in plant–herbivore interactions that could either involve attraction or repelling of certain insects. The effects of viral infections on plants are not limited to herbivores but are also reported in relation to fungal infections of plants.

Similar to many rivers draining arid and semiarid catchments, the San Pedro is spatially and temporally intermittent, with alternating perennial and intermittent reaches. This study incorporated one perennial reach, Grayhawk Nature Center (hereafter Grayhawk) (31.604°N, 110.153°W), and one reach that is intermittent in very dry years, Charleston (31.630°N, 110.178°W). We chose to conduct this study at these two sites to capture a range of environmental conditions present in the San Pedro. Neither reach dried completely during the study period, but Charleston (mean±SE: 23.5°C±0.29) was warmer than Grayhawk (mean±SE: 23.0°C±0.33) throughout the study. Riparian vegetation at the study sites is dominated by Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Gooding's willow (Salix goodingii), seepwillow (Baccharis salicifolia), and saltcedar. These species can be classified along a gradient of drought tolerance, with declining streamflows and groundwater levels causing shifts to drought-tolerant species such as saltcedar. Extremes of this gradient are dominated by a drought-tolerant community or hydric community (Figure 1), although we emphasize that all of these species often co-occur along many desert rivers. The river is inhabited by non-native virile crayfish and red swamp crawfish (Procambarus clarkii), but virile crayfish numerically dominate the study reaches.

While 97% of the respondents correctly identified wheat and rice as incomplete proteins, 25% of the respondents incorrectly identified peanut protein as complete and 27% were not able to identify soy protein as a complete protein. A general question about the factors that are included in protein quality determination found that 40% of the respondents did not identify the amino acid needs of humans and 36% did not identify the digestibility of the protein as being important criteria. Even greater knowledge gaps were apparent with questions about specific protein quality methods of measurement. The only protein quality measurement that scored high for familiarity was BV. It is possible that this was more indicative of a familiarity with the general usage of the term BV versus familiarity with the specific BV method. While the PDCAAS method is the most widely used method for protein quality determination in the United States and globally, only 18% of the respondents were familiar with this method, only 10% correctly identified it as the method used by the FDA for nutrition labeling, and only 11% correctly identified it as the method cited by AND in their position paper on vegetarian diets. Furthermore, a fairly high percentage of respondents did not identify two of the underlying tenets of the method as being important to protein quality determination: amino acid needs of humans and digestibility of a food protein.

PMC8216929_P033,"Devils could maintain the proportional prey composition of their diets, but change aspects of their feeding ecology to accommodate the physical and competitive disadvantages of DFTD infection. For example, infected devils could reduce the overall amount of food they consume. Illness‐induced anorexia can result from a trade‐off between acquiring necessary calories and nutrients, and minimizing energy expended on finding and/or hunting, consuming, and digesting food items. For Tasmanian devils, reduced food consumption may incidentally result in a reduction in social contact. However, we did not see a sharp increase in δ15N in response to DFTD progression or with reduced body condition, which would be expected if food intake reduction and nutritional stress were occurring. A further possibility is that devils with DFTD reduce the likelihood of agonistic contacts with other devils by shifting their activity to times of the diel cycle when devil activity is relatively low. Tasmanian devils have been shown to exhibit flexibility in their temporal activity, likely driven by intraspecific competition for carcasses and times of peak herbivore activity. In low‐density sites, peak devil activity is later (around 22:00) than in high‐density sites (peak activity around 18:00); therefore, infected devils in disease‐affected low‐density sites could avoid competition by foraging in the early evening. Devils could also modify their feeding behavior by abandoning food items more readily on the approach of conspecifics. While direct observations of intraspecific interactions at carcasses have not found strong evidence of dominance hierarchies among devils, larger devils are more likely to displace smaller devils of the same age class. This suggests that costly agonistic interactions over carcasses are more likely if an individual is at a competitive disadvantage relative to other devils at a carcass. Diseased devils may therefore have a lower threshold for retreat from carcasses compared with healthier devils, reducing the chance for close agonistic encounters with conspecifics.",tasmanian devils,tasmanian devils,compete,competition,Sarcophilus harrisii,Sarcophilus harrisii,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

Important to note, different life‐history strategies (e.g., precocial males and jacks), behavioral strategies (e.g., sneaker or satellite males), and other forms of selection (e.g., predation by terrestrial animals) may alter the strength of the relationship between arrival time and body size on reproductive success. In our system, fish that successfully mated were longer than those that did not, but whether this trend is consistent across years remains unknown. Our evaluation of mating success predictors failed to incorporate environmental variables which may have also influenced the distribution of mating and reproductive success. Lastly, although we made concerted efforts to cull sexually immature fish from our analyses of mating systems and sexual selection, it is possible that some fish which were incapable of mating remained, thus introducing bias in our estimates.

PMC3900514_P052,"Classically, there are several different ways of managing fishing mortality: i) by varying fishing effort intensity ii) by changing the exploitation pattern, i.e. the catch by size and iii) by a combination of the above two measures. In areas such as the Mediterranean, characterized by small mesh size in the trawl net cod end (the legal minimum size for European Countries is 40 mm square or 50 mm diamond mesh opening, stock productivity and fleet profitability are generally impaired by a combination of high fishing mortality and inadequate exploitation patterns, with a large number of small sized catches. According to, a simple reduction in the current fishing mortality without any change in the fishing selectivity will not allow either stock biomass or fisheries yield and revenue to be maximized. The negative effect of the combination of poor exploitation pattern and high fishing mortality on small sized fish has been reported also for ICES areas. The Authors also pointed to the existence of a trade-off between the exploitation rate and how this affects fish size (exploitation pattern). In particular, either a combination of a relatively high exploitation rate with a low relative exploitation of immature fish, or a combination of a high relative exploitation of immature fish with a low exploitation rate, could contribute to improving current stock status in the northeastern Atlantic. This is in line with the classical theory of Beverton and Holt who first showed that optimal fishing mortality in an exploited stock depends on the relative selectivity of the exploitation pattern.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC1935014_P035,"The pattern of degradation products on the PAA gel as well as the kinetics of their appearance make it clear that Orn and YtqI employ different mechanisms for the degradation of nanoRNA. 5-mers are not a good substrate for YtqI, they might be degraded in a distributive rather than a processive way. Another obvious difference was the absence of 3-mers from the degradation pattern. One possible explanation for this could be a preferred degradation of 3-mers into 2-mers. When used as substrate, 3-mers are degraded much faster than 5-mers, requiring approximately 10 times less enzyme than 5-mers for complete degradation. We therefore concluded that 3-mers are much better substrates than 5-mers. This in vitro result could reflect the intriguing possibility that YtqI acts preferentially on 3-mers in vivo and cannot efficiently degrade 5-mers. In this case, the fact that YtqI can complement Orn in Escherichia coli could suggest that the accumulation of 3-mers and not 5-mers is the main cause of growth deficiency in Escherichia coli lacking Orn. According to the literature, 90% of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli is done hydrolytically, implying a more significant contribution of RNase II and RNase R as compared to PNPase. The relative contribution of RNase II and RNase R is under dispute; RNase II was considered to be the main contributor to mRNA degradation, but this result was questioned by a genome-wide analysis of mRNA levels in a strain deleted for RNase II. The end products of degradation catalyzed by RNase II and RNase R differ slightly in size; for RNase II experimental data indicate 3–5-mers or 4–6-mers as final product and 4-mers according to the structural model, and RNase R leaves 2–3-mers or 1–2-mers. The size range of fragments produced by RNase R seems to be more suitable for degradation by YtqI than that of oligonucleotides produced by RNase II. The importance of RNase R is increasingly recognized. RNase R has the ability to degrade stable RNA and contributes to quality control of rRNA. More recently this enzyme was shown to be involved in the degradation of mRNA substrates with extensive secondary structure. In addition, RNase R was shown to increase dramatically under different stress conditions. Bacillus subtilis harbors only one member of the RNR family of exoribonucleases, RNase R, which seems to be equally important for the degradation of highly structured RNA as its counterpart in Escherichia coli. Another requirement for oligonucleotide degradation might also come from systems expressed under the control of cyclic dGMP.

Supporting the intermixing between these two populations in summer is the fact that western migrants were the only elk where we found Capillaria sp., a nematode detected in elk populations near the town of Banff but not detected in residents or eastern migrant elk from the Ya Ha Tinda. If this hypothesis is true, western migrants may be responsible for the eastern expansion of giant liver fluke into the Ya Ha Tinda elk population.

However, the population selected to lower salinity in this study had still relatively high mortality in freshwater conditions, although we believe that further selection steps would result in possible adaptation to fresh water. Recent molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed a marked genetic divergence between Caspian and Black Sea populations of Pontogammarus maeoticus, as well as other Ponto‐Caspian crustaceans, such as the invasive cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi, suggesting there are two distinct phylogenetic groups between the two basins, which may have been separated for 5–7 million years. Furthermore, salinity tolerance experiments on 22 populations of eight species originating from the Ponto‐Caspian, Northern European, and Great Lakes‐St. Lawrence River regions demonstrated that different populations of one species can differ significantly in their salinity tolerance, highlighting that adaptation of spatially separated populations of the same species need to be taken into account for ecological analyses. Selection experiments on the copepod E. affinis populations from different salinities further support this notion. Thus, adaptation potential and heritability may also differ widely among populations of the same species. Therefore, we suggest that populations of Pontogammarus maeoticus originating from different salinities may need different length and strength of selection for successful adaptation to freshwater conditions. In contrast, due to unsuccessful selection of the Pontogammarus maeoticus population to higher salinity in this study, and the fact that the majority of Ponto‐Caspian nonindigenous species did not succeed to spread to more saline habitats in their native region through millions of years, nor did they invade the Mediterranean Sea, we suggest a lack of necessary genetic background of those species for adaptation to fully marine environments, which further points to a freshwater origin of relict Ponto‐Caspian species.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

10 values decreased with increasing acclimatization temperature for three reasons. First, metabolic down-regulation for energetic balancing results in a reduced Q
10. Second, Q
10 will decrease near breakpoint temperatures. Third, during thermal fluctuations that involve high peaks in habitat temperature, ectotherms will minimize the sensitivity of their metabolic rate, avoiding excessive rates when exposed to elevated temperatures. Thus, the increasing abundance of relatively nutrient-poor and thermally dynamic habitats causes a gradual shrinking of the ecological niche of these bivalve taxa towards the warm end of their distribution range. The group-specific clines discussed in the preceding paragraph indicated differential adaptation to temperature among Mytilus spp. populations. Since these bivalve species have great dispersal capacities, strongly coupled to hydrodynamic circulation, genetic divergence within these species requires geographic isolation. During isolation in different climatic regions, selective genetic variation may have evolved at the same spatial scale as the observed neutral genetic variation. This may explain why the biogeography of these genetic groups is associated with European temperature gradients. Physiological studies revealed that mussels from different genetic groups exhibit different growth rates when hatched under similar conditions. Differential thermal adaptation has recently been demonstrated for different mussel species from the West coast of North America as well. The differential adaptation to temperature indicated by our results, combined with the strong spatial variability of the coastal climate in the Bay of Biscay, may explain the broad and mosaic-like transition from one mussel-group present in this area to the next.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC4432333_P001,"Biphenyl and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) (a synthetic biphenyl) are persistent organic pollutants in the environment and are causing serious environmental problems around the world. In Japan, the manufacture, import, and use of PCBs were prohibited in 1974. However, environmental pollution with PCB is still ubiquitous in Japan. Aquamicrobium sp. strain SK-2 (accession no. AB612121) was originally isolated from sewage sludge in South Korea, and it can utilize PCB congeners containing one to six chlorine substituents, such as 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexachlorobiphenyl. Strain SK-2 can also degrade biphenyl and PCB in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl and nitrate. In addition, the PCB degradation rate of strain SK-2 is higher than that of previously reported PCB congener-degrading bacteria. Therefore, the isolated strain SK-2 might be a good candidate for the bioremediation of PCB-contaminated soil, especially in high-saline soils. Therefore, the whole-genome sequence of Aquamicrobium sp.

PMC5421309_P010,"We can gain a better appreciation of the two food webs (figure 3a and 3b) and the key players in the trophic dynamics if we quantify the abundance of the vertebrate species in these two ecosystems (figure 4). Small- to medium-sized mammals (small rodents to hares) are most important in terms of trophic flows in both food webs. The moose (Alces alces) is now important in northwestern Europe but is nearly negligible in the Kluane region of the Yukon. The relative importance of the small- to medium-sized herbivores is strikingly different between the two regions. Although the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) are negligible parts of the trophic pyramid of northwestern Europe, their equivalents in North America, the snowshoe hare and the American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), have key roles as primary consumers. The snowshoe hare is, however, much more important than the red squirrel in terms of food-web dynamics because of its strong population cycles and importance as prey for predators (figure 3a). Small rodents, represented by several species of voles (Myodes and Microtus spp.), are clearly most abundant in northwestern Europe, where they are the main prey for many small- and medium-sized predators (figure 3b).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC8402940_P013,"Because inorganic compounds can act as electron donors for denitrification, we search for genes that would suggest potential inorganic electron donors that could drive denitrification. Ca. Desulfobacillus denitrificans possesses two sox gene clusters, soxXAYZ (DSYM_07930‐60) and soxYZAXB (DSYM_23290‐330) (Table 2), but soxCD was not found. The reaction catalyzed by the Sox system in the absence of SoxCD proteins is considered to convert thiosulfate to elemental sulfur (S0) or polysulfide, which produces 2 mol of electrons per mol of thiosulfate. Ca. Desulfobacillus denitrificans also possesses cysDN (DSYM_2680‐90) and sat (DSYM_23250), fccAB (DSYM_09470‐80), dsrAB (DSYM_11230‐40) and aprAB (DSYM_23230‐40), which are also involved in sulfur metabolism (Table 2). The dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide but DsrAB from sulfur‐oxidizing bacteria catalyzes an oxidative reaction. Since the oxidative and reductive type enzymes are phylogenetically distinct, a phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine its type. Because the dsrAB genes from Ca. Desulfobacillus denitrificans clustered with oxidative type enzymes (Figure A3), Ca. Desulfobacillus denitrificans is predicted to oxidize sulfide into sulfate via elemental sulfur (S0), sulfite, and adenosine 5′‐phosphosulfate. The oxidation of sulfur compounds can be coupled with denitrification and these reactions can also be catalyzed by enzymes encoded by cysDN and sat, fccAB, and aprAB, respectively (Table 2).

One of the objectives of the project was to reconstruct past climatic conditions and human environment-interactions on the basis of ecological information derived from beetle remains preserved in the archaeology. Similar palaeo-environmental reconstructions based on sub-fossil insect fauna have been conducted in Alaska, although on older deposits, most of which were not directly connected to human occupations. Sound knowledge of the insect fauna of the study locale is required to both successfully identify disarticulated sub-fossil remains and derive ecological information from them. For this reason, it was decided to conduct a small-scale entomological survey concurrently with the archaeological excavations at Nunalleq. The objective of the survey, beyond familiarisation with the local fauna, was to obtain a sample of the modern beetle fauna from the coastal tundra and anthropogenic habitats with which the beetle sub-fossils from Nunalleq could be compared.

From 1968–1994, excess hippopotami, based on an annual aerial census, were removed lethally or non-lethally from the river systems. In 1993, a severe drought resulted in a significant reduction in hippopotamus numbers, indicating that populations may be naturally regulated, and further lethal management was curtailed in 1995.

PMC3510078_P026,"Although our findings are highly informative, the employed mouse model features limitations. Since Mus musculus and Schistosoma haematobium are both eukaryotes, theoretically speaking these species may feature homologous genes. However, we believe that the probability of orthologs sharing significant nucleotide homology is quite low. Codon usage in mice and trematodes such as Schistosoma haematobium is different, as exemplified by the need for codon optimization to maximize expression of Schistosoma genes by mammalian cells. Moreover, we only injected 3000 eggs per mouse bladder, and eggs are shed in the urine over time. Hence, Schistosoma haematobium RNA is only a small fraction of the total RNA in egg-injected mouse bladder tissue, making it unlikely that Schistosoma haematobium cRNA hybridization to microarray chips (if any) significantly affected our analysis. Another limitation is that our egg injection model does not reproduce the entire Schistosoma haematobium life cycle of the human host. Cercariae are found in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, schistosomula circulate in the systemic and portal circulation, and adult worms reside in the pelvic venous plexus. However, for the purposes of this bladder-focused study, eggs are sufficient since it is the only Schistosoma haematobium life stage present in bladder tissue. It is also possible that Schistosoma haematobium eggs transferred from hamsters (the source of eggs in our model) to a final mouse host may be metabolically and immunologically distinct from eggs laid in situ in a single mouse host. This has been postulated to occur with Schistosoma japonicum eggs. We have controlled for this in part by using control injections of hamster liver and intestine-derived “vehicle”. However, studies are underway to compare in vitro laid eggs to hamster-derived eggs in our mouse model. The single, large egg bolus utilized in our model is unlikely to reflect the kinetics of continuous oviposition in the human host. On the other hand, our model features highly focal, coalescing multiple egg-based granulomata that are reminiscent of those observed in the human bladder. Regardless of these issues, our model mitigates the relative scarcity of early disease stage bladder tissue available for research. Bladder tissue from schistosomiasis patients is typically only available from those undergoing cystectomy or bladder reconstructive surgery for advanced bladder cancer or fibrosis, respectively.

The metabolomics output suggested that certain family members utilized the high nitrogenous substrates present in sediments (See Table 1) to feed it back to glycolysis via the pentose phosphate pathway to pyruvate metabolism, with additional feeding from starch metabolism by other communities. Recent studies have indicated that the salt tolerant members of Methylcoccaceae such as Methylococcus capsulatus have the ability to process nitrogenous substrates via the Benson-Calvin cycle in the presence of methane. This can also be inferred from the considerable upregulation of palmitic acid, which is known to be a major metabolite of this family and other methanotrophs. Similarly, Geobacteraceae activity suggested their role in both the production of isoleucine and valine by recruiting 2-hydroxy butanoate from propanoate metabolism, with pyruvic acid as a precursor, as demonstrated in an earlier study.

This newly quantified coral δ13C vs. water depth relationship may have implications for paleo-sea level reconstructions that utilize massive, symbiont-bearing fossil corals. Instead of assuming a growth position water depth for fossil massive coral samples, mean bulk skeletal δ13C could be used to constrain the growth position water depth for a particular coral sample. In particular, massive Porites and Pavona corals are known to grow over a large range of water depths in clear water45,48,49.

This assumption could be a major source of error in sea level reconstruction studies that utilize massive corals. We suggest that the use of the relationship shown in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1 could constrain growth depths of fossil corals to within 7 m of their true in situ depth (±3.5 m). An age limitation for this approach arises due to the possibility that atmospheric CO2 δ13C and surface ocean DIC δ13C has varied over time. Thus, generating relative water depth estimates based on mean coral δ13C values from corals of vastly different ages could be biased by differences in background DIC δ13C if the atmospheric CO2 concentration was significantly different. Although additional research is needed to better understand the water depth and mean coral δ13C relationship shown in Fig. 5, utilizing skeletal δ13C to constrain growth position depth would be an improvement over the current approach of just assuming water depth based on modern coral ecology and relying on core depth measurements of recovered fossil corals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

In this study, we found that all samples shared a large core microbiota. The core microbiota was dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi. A core gut microbiota has been reported for certain fish species; such as rainbow trout, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon parr, zebrafish and cichlid fishes. In cichlid fishes studied; Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia were reported as predominant phyla. Therefore, this study agrees with the study on cichlid fishes. Identification of unique taxa such as Flexithrix, Aciditerrimonas and Povalibacter in the stomach and 20 genera in the midgut region indicates host physiological selection.

To address these gaps, we recommend that specific guidelines for the treatment of PSAC and WRA be developed and validated under the lead of WHO, including a regular reporting mechanism for the treatment coverage in these groups.

PMC2267998_P022,"Although individual females may show a degree of subregional fidelity to areas such as northward to the Gulf Stream area or eastward to tropical waters, Atlantic leatherbacks could disperse widely across most of the ocean basin but have not yet been tracked across the equator. During their remigration interval, several foraging grounds have been identified: North Atlantic ocean as Scotia Nova, East Costs of USA, Ireland costs, Bay of Biscay or more southern in West African and Iberian coasts. However, two main migration patterns have been showed: northward to the Gulf Stream area or eastward to tropical waters. We hypothesized that these patterns could be linked to different ecological foraging areas, and that this could explain differences in RI between females foraging in those areas. C isotope ratios are conservative from phytoplankton up to top consumers with less than 1‰ enrichment per trophic level and hence are ideal to trace gradients in the marine environment, as the signature of a consumer should reflect the sources of C at the base of the food chain. The δ13C values in the tissue of marine animals have been shown to vary with latitude (e.g., reflecting the depletion of 13C in phytoplankton towards higher latitudes. Moreover, the general pattern of inshore, benthically linked food webs being more enriched in 13C compared with onshore, pelagic food webs presents a potentially useful tool for marine biologists. Also, stable isotope analysis has increasingly been used to infer animal movement patterns from invertebrate to higher vertebrate (see reviews,. Differences in δ13C blood values between 2-year and 3-year RI females suggest that the French Guiana leatherback population segregates into two distinct isotopic groupings, and seem to confirm that RI is linked to foraging areas. As isotope signatures could provide information on both the latitude, and the pelagic vs. neritic nature of the foraging ground, it is possible to reveal foraging area dichotomy for 2-year and 3-year RIs. The low RBC δ13C values in the 2-year RI turtles suggests that the C resource of these turtles is situated in a more northern and/or offshore region (high latitude in North Atlantic), and the high values of the 3-year RI turtles indicate a more southern and/or coastal foraging area (West African and Iberian coasts). Confirming these conclusions, maps of gelatinous organism distribution provide information on prey location and indicate that these foraging areas (central North Atlantic and west coasts of Africa) support several appreciable aggregations of potential prey, especially due to the presence of upwelling and frontal areas. Moreover, leatherbacks are generally considered completely pelagic, but are also observed in coastal waters when food is available.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

The current use of vegetarian and vegan diets was self-reported, and it is known from previous studies that self-identified vegetarians do not necessarily completely abstain from meat6,19. Furthermore, we define “vegetarian/vegan” as a person who sticks to that diet for at least two weeks, which means, that this definition is rather lenient. Therefore, also short-term vegetarians/vegans might be within the survey. We did not assess the motivation for following a vegetarian or vegan diet. A further limitation lies in the lack of assessment of objective measures (e.g., BMI) and the reliance on self-reports. Additionally, considering that this was a cross-sectional study, and that the vegetarian/vegan group was mostly young females, it may be that young females are more prone to having an eating disorder regardless of the diet they follow. Thus, vegetarianism/veganism may be a symptom or maintaining factor of the disorder rather than linked to its causal development. Due to the cross-sectional design in this study, no conclusions can be made regarding the causality of the association between diet and the examined individual differences.

After removal of short and low quality sequences, all remaining 11306 sequences were pooled and re-clustered in 194 OTUs using a 99% identity threshold. OTUs were divided in three different groups according to which hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene they belonged to and phylogenetic trees were constructed for each hypervariable region. In all trees, the five major clades of “Ca.

However, many not yet described lineages are present in addition to the previously identified clades, for example in the tree based on hypervariable region V4–V6, at least six additional clades can be observed (Fig. 5). It was impossible to assign each clade to a specific environment according to OTU environmental distribution (Fig. 5), thus a more detailed analysis was performed to investigate the ecology of different “Ca. Megaira” clades. Frequency of occurrence (calculated as the number of microbiome samples positive for “Ca.

Cryptomys foxi, is a subterranean rodent belonging to the family Bathyergidae and occupies tropical dry lowland grasslands, riverside woodlands and rocky places in colonies which excavate extensive burrows111,112. While gross anatomical and histological details on the structure of the respiratory system of Cricetomys gambianus exist60,113, Cryptomys foxi has not hitherto been investigated. Here, it was observed that while the lobulation of the lungs of the two species differed markedly, at histological- and ultrastructural levels, the organs were quite similar. They also resembled those of surface- and underground dwelling rodents114,115. The undivided left lung of Cricetomys gambianus, which was also reported in the same rodent by Ibe et al.60, and the existence of three lobes on the left lung of Cryptomys foxi are not unique morphological features: various permutations in the lobulations of the lung occur in the mammalian lungs61,62,113,116–121. Ostensibly, there is no evidence showing that lobulation of the lung is of functional consequence122–134. In their gross and histological study, Ibe et al.59 reported that the respiratory system of Cricetomys gambianus was ‘poorly’ developed and deduced that it was much less efficient in gas exchange compared to those of other small rodents. Although the interpretation is supported by this study, the conclusion reached (by Ibe et al.59) in the investigation was not merited by the simple data adduced. For both Cricetomys gambianus and Cryptomys foxi, the numerous pulmonary goblet cells and alveolar macrophages should constitute an important part of the pulmonary defense system124,135,136: the air in the burrows is presumably highly polluted and loaded with pathogens and particulates.

Similar design was reported in the lung of Heterocephalus glaber by Maina et al.61,62 where the septal architecture was ascribed to possible neotenic or paedomorphic phylogenetic status of the species which is the most basal of the African mole rat lineages46. Among the air-breathing vertebrates, double capillary arrangement characterizes the amphibian126,128,137,138 and the reptilian128,138,139 lungs while in the mammalian lung the design normally occurs during the early stages of embryonic development140.",Cricetomys gambianus,monkeypox virus,host,parasitism,Cricetomys gambianus,Monkeypox virus,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,TRUE,,NA

The weaving of hats with Brahea dulcis leaves is carried out by nearly 84 % of the households, while 10 % are specialized in handcrafting baskets, covers for bottles and other products. Hats are interchanged almost every day for maize, food or money in local stores. From 2011 to 2015 the price of each hat was 0.16 US dollars (based on an interchange rate of $20.00 Mexican pesos by one American dollar), while in 2000 it was $0.12. A household weave on average 28.9 ± 3.65 hats per week, and each hat requires 4.1 young leaves, which means approximately one million of leaves used in the whole community per year. Leaves extraction is carried out mainly in palm scrublands, where Brahea dulcis is promoted, protected and tolerated in areas of agricultural fields, but it is widely distributed throughout the whole territory (Figs. 3 and 4). For extracting palm leaves, people cut the young leaves without damaging the apical meristem and avoid gathering leaves during the new moon, otherwise they consider the growth of new leaves can be delayed. Harvesting palm leaves for direct use and local interchange is allowed but sale to regional sellers is forbidden. Palm is considered staple plant as people said “palms are our life because with palm leaves we make hats and we can get all we need to live”.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC6002536_P012,"The introduction of dingoes to Australia remains enigmatic. Although molecular date estimates have raised the possibility of a late Pleistocene introduction of dogs to Australia13,18 there is, as yet, no archaeological evidence for dingoes prior to c. 3,500 years ago. In addition, divergence dates may relate to events that predate the arrival of dingoes to Australia, so have limited application to understanding the introduction timing and process. Recent genetic analyses of modern dingoes and NGSDs show a geographical distribution of dingo mtDNA lineages that distinguishes populations from the northwest and southeast of Australia18,30, which we also see in the modern dingo sequences we generated (Fig. 1). This population structure is also observable in results from nuclear and Y-chromosome analyses30–33. In addition, the two dingo groups, while more closely related to the NGSDs than to any other dogs, diverge from the NGSD sequence, which may indicate a period of isolation between the two groups of dogs. The only genetic data from NGSDs has been obtained from the captive population derived from only eight dogs34. Village dogs in New Guinea however possess many, if not all, of the behavioural and phenotypic characteristics ascribed to NGSDs35 and it is possible that sampling from isolated village populations on the New Guinea mainland, and highland NGSD populations if found to still exist, may also be informative about NGSD and dingo ancestral history.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC7400821_P022,"Among the novel flour products, broccoli, sweet potato and hemp flour were also very high in dietary fibre, even higher than legume flour. Legume flour has been investigated for suitability in baking, and when mixed with other grains to make bread, biscuits and other baked products. The amino acid profile of legumes is known to be complementary to cereal grains, improving the nutritional properties. However, legume varieties with lower levels of antinutrients would be preferred. Lentils, chickpeas and peas have been trialed, with acceptable results where chemical leavening is also used. High-quality bread is more difficult to produce with legume flour, as the protein in legumes do not form a gluten network and reduce the ability of the wheat proteins in forming visco-elastic properties, limiting the incorporation of air and therefore gas retention, impacting on the structure of the crumb and overall texture. An 80–20% wheat–lentil flour bread has been tested with success, with researchers commenting on the favourable carbohydrate profile and prebiotic functionality, which possibly assists with overall bowel health. The competitive nature of legume flour in a bread would be more detrimental in a wholemeal bread product, where the bran also has an impact, slicing through gluten strands and affecting the overall structure of the gluten matrix. So where protein and dietary fibre content would be improved through the addition of legume flour, the wheat flour would almost certainly need to be refined, although Brescianai et al. comments that studies often do not specify any details on the type of base flour, making comparisons between studies difficult and conclusions regarding the optimal formulation an opportunity for future research.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC3715749_P013,"We initiated the current study to gain clearer insights into the plasmid profile of Acinetobacter sp. DS002 isolated from agricultural soils polluted with OP insecticides. The circular DNA, pTS236 was the smallest of the rescued plasmids of Acinetobacter sp. DS002. Analysis of its sequence led to the discovery of a link between pTS236 and Sphinx 2.36. The Sphinx 2.36 sequence matches throughout its length the sequence of pTS236 and shows an overall 67% match at the nucleotide sequence level. In a recent network analysis, only the pTS236 homologue, p4ABAYE, showed no apparent link with existing Acinetobacter plasmids13. This lack of evolutionary linkage prompted the question as to whether pTS236 might be a replicative form of a phage genome propagating using Acinetobacter sp. DS002 as a host. We have therefore examined a polyethylene glycol precipitate of the spent medium by TEM. Our initial observations under TEM gave no indication of the presence of phage particles and hence it was assumed that pTS236 is a unique plasmid found in Acinetobacter sp. DS002 cells. However, further purification steps of the PEG precipitate of the spent medium enriched phage particles and the existence of icosahedral phage particles was confirmed (Fig. 6, panel I). These pure phage particles have also cross-reacted with Orf106 and Orf96 antibodies and the viral immune-precipitation (VIP) assay performed to amplify pTS236 from immune-purified viruses amplified pTS236-specific sequences (Fig. 6 II, III, IV).

PMC5546546_P001,"Bacterial small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are regulatory RNAs that are heterogeneous in size (generally approximately 50 to 250 nucleotides) and structure. sRNAs are known to function in a number of regulatory processes such as inhibition and activation of translation, degradation and stabilization of mRNA, transcriptional interference, and control of protein activity. sRNAs are usually classified into five categories based on their regulatory mechanisms. Cis-encoded base-pairing RNAs are those that bind to their mRNA target with the highest degree of complementarity. An example of this type of sRNA is GadY, which is involved in the regulation of the acid response system of Escherichia coli.1,2 Riboswitches are cis-regulatory elements that directly bind a metabolite when abundance of this metabolite exceeds a threshold level. This binding induces a conformational change in the RNA to form a structure that affects transcription termination or translation initiation.3 Some riboswitches also function as sRNAs and are able to act in trans, such as the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) riboswitches SreA and SreB of Listeria monocytogenes.4 These two riboswitches regulate the expression of the virulence regulator PrfA by pairing with the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of its mRNA.4
Trans-encoded base-pairing small RNAs have limited complementarity to their target mRNA(s) and can, in some cases, regulate more than one target. A well-characterized example of a trans-encoded regulatory sRNA is RyhB, which is involved in the regulation of intracellular iron usage in bacteria such as Escherichia coli.5 Protein modulator sRNAs are ones that counter the activities of mRNA-binding proteins. An example is CsrB, which is part of the carbon storage regulator (Csr) system in Escherichia coli.6 The final category consists of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNAs (crRNAs), which are palindromes interspaced with short unique spacer sequences that act as a defense mechanism against homologous foreign DNA, such as that from viruses.7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

For the Tn5-Erm magic pool, we used 10 variants of the antibiotic resistance gene upstream region (part2), 5 variants of the Erm antibiotic resistance gene (part3), and 25 variants of the transposase upstream region (part5), resulting in 1,250 possible combinations of parts (Table S5).

PMC5797145_P004,"Having established these conditions in laboratory media, we next assessed the ability of ϕHP3 to kill ExPEC in human blood. ExPEC strain JJ2528 was incubated in the absence or presence (MOI 0.1–1,000) of ϕHP3 in untreated human blood or HIP blood, and the extent of killing was assessed by determining the CFUs remaining after treatment. Interestingly, unlike the very efficient 2.5 logarithmic reduction in ExPEC levels by ϕHP3 at an MOI of 0.1 in LB (Fig. 3), no decrease in bacterial cell numbers was observed under identical conditions in blood, regardless of the presence of active complement (Fig. 4A and B). Efficient phage killing activity was not observed with MOIs as high as 100; and only at an MOI of 1,000 was any significant reduction in ExPEC levels observed in HIP-B under these conditions. Hypothesizing that the anticoagulant EDTA, a metal chelation agent, might be contributing to this dramatic reduction in phage lytic activity, the same experiments were performed in untreated blood or HIP-B blood where heparin was used as the anticoagulant. Interestingly, although the phage killing efficiency was still markedly reduced compared to L broth (approximately 2–3 logarithms less efficient; compare Fig. 4C,D to Fig. 3), the killing was still 2 logarithms more efficient in blood treated with heparin than EDTA (compare Fig. 4C,D with A,B). Taken together, this data suggests the phage HP3 is 100-fold less efficient in killing ExPEC in heparized blood than it is in broth culture, which is further inhibited another 100-fold if EDTA is used as the anti-coagulant. Blood from two additional donors treated with EDTA did not yield phage-dependent killing of ExPEC in HIP-B from either donor, suggesting this effect is not due to differences in donor phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 2).

In this paper, we explore some of these interactions through observation of heterologously expressed coat proteins. This continues from the work of Krajcikova et al. who probed coat proteins from the so‐called ‘insoluble fraction’ – CotE, CotV, CotW, CotX, CotY and CotZ. These are all proteins associated with the outer coat and crust. During sporulation, these proteins are among the most highly expressed of all the Bacillus subtilis proteins. CotE orthologues are found across a broad range of Bacillus species, including those of the Bacillus cereus group. Orthologues of CotV–CotZ do not appear to be found in all Bacillus species, but are nevertheless widely distributed; notably CotY appears to be common to all members of the Bacillus cereus group as well as Bacillus subtilis. None of the proteins mentioned earlier appears among the genomes of Clostridia. In Bacillus subtilis, genes encoding CotV and CotW lie upstream of the cotXYZ operon and are grouped in one gene cluster, implying some functional relationship. CotY and CotZ are cysteine‐rich proteins with CotY containing 15 cysteines (out of 161 residues). CotY is present in multimeric forms. Krajcikova et al. identified in vitro interactions between CotY and CotZ, CotV and CotW, along with homotypic interactions of CotE and CotY. Following from this work, we now identify some key questions that we can start to address by analysing interactions among these coat proteins in more detail:(i) To what extent does the architecture of the coat arise from self‐organisation?(ii) How is the predicted protein interaction network reflected in the three‐dimensional architecture of coat assemblies?(iii) What are the specific interactions that position Cot proteins in the coat and what stabilises them?(iv) How are the characteristic ‘shell‐like’ structures formed?(v) Are there common features of coat assembly across bacterial species?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

Tetraselmis suecica was filtered three times faster than Nannochloris atomus, which is smaller and immobile. These data are in agreement with the optimal prey size reported for Brachionus species. The clearance efficiencies of Brachionus plicatilis for Tetraselmis suecica were lower than recorded in previous studies. This discrepancy might be because we used rotifer neonate females in our experiments, whereas female age was not controlled in Ciros-Pérez et al.. Neonates are smaller than adults, and because the size of the particles that they can ingest is limited by body size, their algae filtration rates are expected to be lower.",Brachionus plicatilis,Nannochloris atomus,filter,consumption,Brachionus plicatilis,Picochlorum atomus,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

At the same time, this species seemingly exhibits a highly developed capacity for rapid wound healing after skin injury. In this context, it is important to understand the contribution of the resident bacterial community on the skin to such properties. In the present study, we therefore investigated bacterial community structure of skin samples from a population of black-tip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in the Amirante Islands (Seychelles). Of the sharks sampled, a proportion were noticeably affected by skin insults (lesions) and surface irregularities, especially around and behind the gills.

We showed that expression of the yoeBSpn toxin-GFP fusion gene apparently triggered apoptosis, which resulted in lethality in Arabidopsis thaliana; therefore, we suggested that the conditional expression of yoeBSpn toxin could be used to ablate pollen formation for the development of male sterile plants for containment of transgenic plants or for hybrid seed production. In the current study, we investigated the effects of co-expressing the yefMSpn antitoxin and yoeBSpn toxin in Arabidopsis thaliana by cross-pollination between plants carrying either the yefMSpn antitoxin or yoeBSpn toxin-GFP fusion in inducible plant gene expression constructs.",Streptococcus pneumoniae,humans,infect,parasitism,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Homo,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC6605681_P025,"It is worth noting that though A26 protein only exists on MV and not on EV, it has been hypothesized that A26 protein in cells can negatively regulate MV egress to Golgi to form EV. Since all of our designed acid-insensitive A26 mutant viruses exhibit small plaque sizes, we rationalized that conformational changes of A26 protein may also control MV to EV egress at late phase in infected cells. Subsequent isolation of revertant viruses from the WR-A26-H2R, WR-A26-H3R and WR-A26-H2-CAT mutant viruses was unexpected. However, these revertant viruses clearly demonstrate how vaccinia mature virus can cope with detrimental mutations of A26 protein and how, through second-site mutations in A26 protein, the revertant mature virus regains host cell entry ability by switching from endocytosis to plasma membrane fusion (Fig 8). Apart from the three revertants reported in Fig 7, we analyzed additional revertants with the large plaque phenotype—Rev2 and 3 from WR-A26-H2R; Rev2, 3 and 4 from WR-A26-H3R; and Rev2, 3, and 4 from WR-A26-H2-CAT (S3 Fig.)—and immunoblots showed that all of these revertants contain a smaller form of A26 protein or no A26 protein at all (S4 Fig). PCR amplification and sequencing of A26L genes from these viral genomes revealed additional second-site mutations within the A26L ORF (S5 Fig.) that resulted in a frame-shift and premature termination of A26 protein (S6 Fig.), consistent with our immunoblot data and supporting our model shown in Fig 8.

Herein, we propose a proof of concept panning process coined ‘Yin-Yang’ panning using antigen preparations devoid of purification for biopanning. We applied the process to isolate monoclonal scFv against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nucleoprotein (MERS-NP). The ‘Yin-Yang’ concept takes its name from the Taoist concept of duality in striking a balance to form a whole. Here, the crude extract consisting of the antigen of interest in its native form alongside the endogenous Escherichia coli proteins are used to achieve a balance between positive and negative selection. Due to the complex microenvironment during target enrichment, reducing non-specific binding interaction to Escherichia coli proteins and blocking agents is paramount to allow effective antigen-antibody interaction to take place. A capture and elimination step was introduced prior to biopanning to remove the influence of binders against the non-target proteins. The complete workflow is outlined in the following schematic diagram (Fig. 1). The proposed approach was able to isolate monoclonal scFv clones against the MERS-NP utilizing a crude preparation.

The members of OTU1 (Dyella), OTU81 (Rhizobium), and OTU19 (Unclassified-Rhodobacteraceae) were negatively correlated with l-selenocysteine, and OTU19 members were also correlated with angelicin and isopentenyl phosphate. l-Selenocysteine is one of the biological function forms of selenium in the plants and is volatile. Selenium is a vital micronutrient that is required to maintain homeostasis of several tissues, and there is a complex interaction mechanism between selenium and microbiota. Some bacterial species take advantage of the existence of selenium in their surrounding environments, and in some microbiomes, bacteria and host immune cells may compete for an inadequate supply of selenium. A previous study revealed that the volatilization of plant selenium is related to the plant rhizosphere microorganisms, but its mechanism is still unclear, so the influence of the volatilization of plant selenium on the interaction between plants and soil microorganisms is one of the topics to which should be paid special attention and which should be developed by in-depth study in the future. Angelicin is a specific group of secondary metabolites that is commonly present in higher plants, and previous studies in Heracleum sosnowskyi showed that angelicin is the principal allelochemical in fruits. Interestingly, angelicin displayed the highest antibacterial activity and might have ecological significance for the interaction between plants and other living organisms. Plant genomes encode isopentenyl phosphate kinases (IPKs) that reactivate isopentenyl phosphate (IP) via ATP-dependent phosphorylation, forming the primary metabolite isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), used generally for isoprenoid/terpenoid biosynthesis. Terpenoid metabolites play a variety of basic functions in plant growth and development. In addition, the ecological importance of terpenoids has received increasing attention for developing strategies for plants to resist biotic and abiotic stresses.",plants,rhizosphere bacteria,interact with,symbiosis,Embryophyta,Bacteria,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC6899801_P006,"DOM was extracted from culture supernatant of three strains of AOA, Nitrosopumilus adriaticus NF5, Nitrosopumilus piranensis D3C, and Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of solid‐phase extracted DOM (SPE‐DOM) from archaeal cultures harvested during late exponential growth ranged from 3.5 to 5.0 μM, which was on average 2–3 times higher than DOC concentrations of medium blanks (data not shown). We were not able to determine the extraction efficiencies required to remove salts due to the high concentrations of organic HEPES buffer (10 mM) in the culture medium (see Supporting Information), which was not retained by the applied SPE method (see Experimental Procedures) as suggested by the absence of the corresponding mass and molecular formula in our FT‐ICR‐MS analysis. Extraction efficiencies of DOC from seawater are ~60% on average, typically exhibiting a C/N ratio similar to the original DOM. However, DOC extraction efficiencies in cultures of heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton are typically lower, ranging from 2% to 50%. The amount of SPE‐DOC released by the three archaeal strains was significantly lower than has been previously determined for heterotrophic bacteria. Given the energetic differences between the oxidation of ammonia (ΔG = −271 kJ mol−1 NH3) and glucose (−2883 kJ mol−1 glucose), it is not surprising that these organisms are not releasing as much (fixed) carbon as compared to heterotrophic bacteria. For autotrophic ammonia‐oxidizers, it is much more costly to produce these extracellular compounds. The carbon yield from nitrification of Nitrosopumilus adriaticus has previously been reported to be ~0.1 (fmol C fixed cell−1 d−1/ fmol N oxidized cell−1 d−1).

An example of a well-described phenomenon of virus–virus interactions is superinfection immunity conferred by lysogenic viruses, which can inhibit coinfection of cultures and single cells. While this mechanism has been described in several species, its frequency at broader taxonomic scales and its occurrence in natural settings is not well known. Most attention in virus–virus interactions has focused on mechanisms limiting coinfection, with the assumption that coinfection invariably reduces host fitness. However, some patterns of nonrandom coinfection suggest elevated coinfection and specific viral mechanisms that promote co-infection have been identified, including enhanced expression of the phage attachment site upon infection, particle aggregation, and phage–phage communication. Systematic coinfection has been proposed to explain findings of chimeric viruses of mixed nucleic acids in metagenome reads. This suspicion was confirmed in a study of marine bacteria that found highly nonrandom patterns of coinfection between ssDNA and dsDNA viruses in a lineage of marine bacteria, but the frequency of this phenomenon across bacterial taxa remains to be uncovered.

Some evidence comes from the tropics, where jacamars Galbula ruficauda were shown to prey on Heliconius butterflies, which are noxious.

A similar strategy was shown in a study with grosbeaks, which ceased eating monarch butterflies Danaus plexippus when the dose of toxins ingested was too high. Most studies showing the ability to deal with toxins have used quite large-bodied bird species such as the starling or blackbird, which probably cope more easily with toxins. Other studies have used birds which are at least partly grani- or frugivorous, such as the black-headed grosbeak, chaffinch, green finch, and yellowhammer. Grani- and frugivorous birds can be adapted to ingesting some plant toxins and may have developed strategies for dealing with the toxin intake.

PMC7051984_P036,"The interactions among conspecifics constitutes the social environment of herds. Such interactions establish the social status occupied and the behaviors adopted by each individual. For example, the roles of leader and follower, dominant and submissive, and producer and scrounger, are extensively documented in ruminants, birds and other foraging species. Socially responsive individuals adjust their behaviors according to the social context and within the limits of their personality plasticity. Thus, the social herd environment is a major factor of behavioral variation that affects the phenotypic expression of grazing personality and its plasticity at the individual and collective level. In section The Effect of Personality Plasticity and Regulatory Systems on Grazing Patterns, we provided examples of how the social environment (e.g., social isolation and parental care) affects the behavior of individuals. Similarly, the emergence of socially central individuals (e.g., leader and dominant animals) conditions collective grazing behaviors. For example, in Highland cattle (Bos taurus), Sueur et al. reported that castrated mature males provided leadership and promoted group cohesiveness to juvenile cattle. These authors suggested using trained matured castrated males to increase grazing intensity of targeted areas. In another experiment with groups of fallow deer (Dama dama), Stutz et al. showed that high aggregation and cohesiveness working toward increasing safety against predators have reduced the individual and collective exploitation of preferred and more nutritious diets. Thus, the collective perceived risk of predators influences collective exploration and utilization of feed sources. Another way to study the effects of collective behaviors is by replacing (or removing) socially central individuals. Vital and Martins removed the key individuals from a group of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and reported reduced learning of foraging skills. In bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) the presence of certain individuals was crucial to maintain interactions between subgroups. However, in beef cattle the effects of socially central individuals might be only relevant in small size herds, for example <40 individuals, where the fidelity of individuals to the group they belong to is relatively high; on the contrary, social bonds in larger herds are expected to be weaker. In the collective context of colony living organisms, the social environment is crucial for the survival and fitness of the group as well as for the relative success of each individual; to a certain extent, this is also the case for collective grazers such as grazing ruminants and other large herbivores.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

To estimate the current trophic position of the squid in the food web, stable isotopes (∂13C; ∂15N) were analyzed in muscle mantle tissue of 54 specimens including those that were used for gladii analysis. Muscle tissue samples were treated as the gladii. They were also freeze-dried for 24h and ground to a fine powder. However, lipids from muscle tissue samples were extracted using chloroform and the remaining tissue was dried over night at 50°C.

PMC7532286_P048,"While we have focused on the role of resistance generated by mucoidy, the results of our experiments do not rule out a substantial role of surface, or envelope, resistance in the dynamics of Escherichia coli and its lytic phage. Indeed, if envelope resistant mutants are less costly than mucoid, any envelope resistant mutants that do enter a community of bacteria and phage will increase in frequency. Consistent with this prediction is that in some cases we observed envelope resistance arising within mucoid cultures. Most notably this occurs with T5 phage, where envelope resistance is expected to have minimal or no cost. There is also evidence that mucoidy and other resistance mechanisms can arise together within single cultures. Our results indicate that the evolution and utility of mucoidy, as compared with other phage resistance mechanisms, will depend heavily on the strains involved and the environmental context of the interaction. Under these conditions (laboratory Escherichia coli exposed to single strains of phage in liquid media), the exponential growth rate was a reasonably informative measure of fitness, but this is known to be untrue in other scenarios, and particularly in more complex environments. Understanding the selective forces that are likely to dominate in different contexts will therefore be relevant for a global understanding of mucoidy as a part of phage-bacteria interactions. Finally, our models and experimental results suggest that if mucoidy evolves first, mutants with more specific resistance mechanisms are, with the exceptions like T5, unlikely to ascend.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC3991660_P001,"Settlement is a key process in the life cycle of meroplanktonic organisms as it determines the distribution of adult populations and community structure. This is mainly because settlers undergo high mortality rates as a consequence of their extreme vulnerability to a variety of factors during this period. Starvation and predation are two important causes of mortality during settlement. Therefore, selective pressure promotes a pool of the morphological traits and larval behavioral strategies that could drive settlement in microhabitats with high availability of food and refuge from predators. As a consequence, in most marine meroplankton selection of settlement habitat is not a random choice. For example, coastal fish and crabs usually use a nursery ground, where competent larvae settle in abundance on structurally complex habitat, which provide a visual refugee from predators. Also, preference for settlement in microhabitats with abundant organic matter has been also reported and direct or indirect signals of food availability can be a strong settlement cue.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC6303027_P004,"The goal of the present study was to examine the extent to which key features of the hydrodynamic environment predicted the occurrence of 10 fish species from five distinct trophic groups at a fish aggregation site over a six-year period. The hydrodynamic features chosen for this study ranged in temporal scale from daily (tidal regimes) too seasonal (water temperature) through to inter-annual periodicities. Using multivariate hierarchical analysis, we examined the temporal changes in fish assemblages at a fish aggregation site and behavioural observations over time enabled hypotheses to be advanced regarding the drivers for aggregations at particular times. We predicted from research at other aggregation sites that: a) aggregation of fishes for the purpose of reproduction would have a seasonal signature, synchronised by lunar and tidal cues to take advantage of strong currents that advect gametes away from reef heterotrophs; b) tidal inputs of planktonic and smaller nekton may result in a consistent presence of planktivores and piscivorous fish predators and c) on short time scales reversals of the daily tidal cycle would be the most potent source of variation, with planktivores and their predators exploiting the incoming tidal flow, and reproductive aggregations and egg predators associated with the outgoing flow. Because of the requirement of intensive sampling at limited locations, long-term studies involve a trade-off between temporal and spatial monitoring. While marine macroecology has benefitted from the analysis of spatially extensive data sites, inferences about processes are best evaluated by dynamic data collected over important temporal scales and the latter was the focus for the current study. The long-term monitoring of this single location yielded a unique and detailed perspective of the significant temporal drivers of fish abundance at a tropical multi-species fish aggregation site at the scales of years, seasons, lunar phases and tides.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC3548464_P001,"Viruses in the family Retroviridae, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian immunodeficiency virus, avian sarcoma virus, and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV),3 utilize reverse transcription to replicate the genetic information stored in their RNA genome. Mutational analyses indicate that the viral capsid plays a critical role in this event because even small structural changes can disrupt the process. A retrovirion cycles through morphological transitions: viral particle assembly, budding, and maturation occurs in producer cells; the particle is disassembled in the newly infected target cell. At the onset of HIV-1 assembly, the structural precursor polyprotein, Gag, assembles underneath the plasma membrane. During or after budding, maturational changes proceed wherein the full-length Gag proteins in the assemblages are cleaved by viral-encoded protease (PR) to generate three major products, matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC). These are arranged to comprise a MA shell underlying the lipid envelope and a conical (e.g. HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus, EIAV, i.e. lentivirus subgroup) or spherical (e.g. avian sarcoma virus) CA core that encapsulates the genome, which is bound to NC. For all retroviruses the N-terminal 12–13 residues of CA, unstructured within Gag, refold into a β-hairpin structural motif stabilized by a Pro1-Asp51 (HIV-1) salt bridge. The salt bridge involving the conserved residue proline 1 is essential and any mutations affecting salt bridge stability will unfold the β-hairpin and cause defects in the assembled capsid that eventually result in noninfectious virions. Correct assemblage of native CA proteins during viral maturation ensures protection and integrity of the packaged viral genome. After virion entry into another host cell, the capsid disassembles to allow its genomic RNA to be released and reverse transcribed. This step requires the structural integrity and correct assembly of CA proteins.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

While capturer males showed no significant difference in frequency of guarding attempts depending on sex of a target (Fig 2A), they terminated capture in a shorter time when their target was a living male (Fig 2B). This sex-dependent termination of capture was not observed in experiments with freshly killed targets (Fig 3B), suggesting importance of physiological condition of a target in interruption of capture. The vigorous movement observed in captured males (S3 Movie) might serve as a rejection signal and contributes to avoidance of male-male pair formation, eventually allowing both males involved an opportunity to form a pair with a female.

However, this is not surprising since a number of different genes are known to play a role in the development of polydactyly, both in humans and in dogs, where it occurs more commonly in large breeds, such as Saint Bernard and Bernese. The regions hosting the significantly associated SNPs included several of such genes. In particular PITX1 (paired-like homeodomain 1) on chr11 and BMP7 (bone morphogenetic protein 7) on chr24 are known to be implicated in the development of polydactyly in a number of species, similar to LMBR1 (limb development membrane protein 1) on chr16, that Park et al. demonstrated to be responsible for such trait in a Korean dog breed.

PMC8249818_P030,"As a key tissue in regulating metabolism, the liver presented changes in the gene expression patterns of mitochondrial proteins related to energy metabolism and fusion/fission balance in response to diet and exercise. In the present study, the significant decrease in the cox4/cs ratio in the HE group under VS conditions suggests that lipid oxidation was greater in this group. In agreement with this, LeMoine and coworkers reported that the liver of goldfish fed a high-fat diet showed an increase in cs mRNA levels, but not in cox gene expression. Furthermore, Sánchez-Nuño and collegues demonstrated that gilthead seabream fed a high-fat diet showed an increase in the activity of CS, but not of COX. The COX/CS activity ratio indicates modifications of the mitochondrial surface/volume ratio, which reflects shifts in the use of nutrients. Thus, the significant decrease in the COX/CS ratio in the livers of fish fed a HE diet showed a clear metabolism shifting toward increased lipid oxidation in this group, which reflects that this tissue possesses a good plasticity for modifying the nutrient utilization depending on the diet composition. As a consequence of this shift, we observed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which could explain the increase in ucp2 expression to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. UCPs have a role as redox sensors that can serve to attenuate the effects of the ROS. The expression of ucp1 increases when lipid flux to the liver increases in carp and in gilthead seabream. In our study, ucp1 and ucp2 showed different expression profiles, suggesting different roles of these proteins in achieving a balance between uncoupling activity and oxidative capacity. Although the role and tissue specificity of UCPs in gilthead seabream have been investigated, some overlap and redundancy might occur among UCPs, especially in relation to UCP2. High mRNA levels of ucp2 and lower mRNA levels of pgc1a in the liver of the HE diet group under VS conditions are consistent with that observed in mammals presenting metabolic syndrome with increased lipid accumulation and ROS production. By contrast, the higher mRNA levels of pgc1a in the HP diet group indicated a higher oxidation rate of dietary protein, yielding a lower energy output and explaining the lower expression of ucp2.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

Kinetic comparisons among the different compounds were made at the previously published lower range of the MIC (12.5 μM) (Fig. 7A). Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline showed a ~97% decrease in bioluminescence at 1 and 2 h, respectively; whereas oligomycin A was inactive at 12.5 μM.

Compared to an untreated bacterial sample, 1-Pro9 caused ~20% reduction in bioluminescence at 12.5 μM within 2 hours.

Peptoids were active in killing the bacteria within 10 minutes. It is clear that peptoids and AMPs differ in their mechanisms of action from the tested conventional antibiotics since they killed bacteria within 10 min, whereas the conventional antibiotics showed killing after 1 hour.

PMC4928843_P040,"In this study we reconstructed the demographic history of two endemic radiations of Midas cichlids inhabiting the small and isolated crater lakes Apoyo and Xiloá to infer whether complex periods of geographic isolation may have facilitated speciation within the two radiations. Apart from this main objective our large genome-wide data set suggests that most of the species evolved in a burst of speciation, thus making these two radiations of cichlids, to our knowledge, the first empirical examples of multispecies outcomes of sympatric speciation. Moreover, these radiations of nine species took place within only about a thousand generations, making them some of the fastest speciation rates reported so far. Unlike recent evidence presented for Cameroonian crater lake cichlids, our population clustering and phylogenetic analyses are consistent with a scenario of primary divergence-with-gene-flow (sympatric speciation) of the crater lake species. Interestingly though, our models do provide evidence for a secondary colonization from the source population that happened shortly before the species radiated in both crater lakes. Whether Midas cichlids represent therefore a good case of sympatric speciation may ultimately depend on the definition of sympatric speciation. The species flocks of Midas cichlids in the Nicaraguan crater lakes arose via sympatric speciation in the sense that their divergence happened most likely in a geographic setting that does not offer geographic barriers to gene flow. Yet, if the admixture event from the source population was instrumental for seeding speciation in sympatry by providing some of the genetic variation involved in reproductive isolation, then a short period of geographic isolation would have been involved in speciation. This would make the radiations of Midas cichlids no longer a case of ‘pure’ sympatric speciation, similarly to the sympatric divergence of apple maggot flies in North America for example. Whether the admixture event was essential for speciation remains to be elucidated. If confirmed, this could partly explain how Midas cichlids have speciated so rapidly in sympatry. It would also exemplify that the term ‘primary divergence’ may have a different meaning when applied at the level of populations and incipient species or at the level of individual genetic variants that distinguish them while the rest of the genome can be exchanged freely. Overall, rather than adding to the debate over whether speciation conforms to a single category of speciation or not we think the results presented here open up a new and exciting hypothesis of how speciation may have happened in the extremely young and repeated radiations of Midas cichlids.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC7997919_P014,"Network analysis elucidates the significant associations between host–parasite, host–bacteria and bacteria–environmental factors40,41. For example, Needham et al.32 revealed the profiles and the relationship of the bacteria and virus to identify interconnectivities. In this study, the Akashiwo sanguinea node was associated with specific bacterial OTUs, and after the bloom, increases in specific environmental nodes (such as NH4+ and PO43−) were associated with other bacterial OTUs. In particular, fewer bacterial–phytoplankton interactions were observed compared with those of bacteria–bacteria. This result is consistent with the finding of Cui et al.36. The interactions between bacteria are more complicated than those between the hosts are (here, HABs) and bacteria. Our network analysis results are consistent with those of the RDA. Thus, certain bacteria specifically respond in the HABs phycosphere, and after the termination of HABs, the changes in the environment due to the released substances from the destruction of HAB cells cause changes in other specific bacteria.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC4271704_P023,"During bloom situations Phaeocystis is mostly found as large colonies protected by a semi-permeable membrane. In early studies these colonies were thought of as cells within a mucopolysaccharide matrix, but this has been revised to a model where an outer membrane encloses Phaeocystis cells within a liquid matrix. Indeed, microscopic inspection of Phaeocystis antarctica colonies showed free-moving and rapidly swimming ciliates within the colony matrix (Delmont, unpublished data). Because of its virtually monotypic blooms and the large cells/colony size Phaeocystis antarctica can be readily enriched by size fractionation. We showed that >3-μm fractions are significantly enriched with the Gammaproteobacteria SAR92. A preliminary estimate indicates that SAR92 and Phaeocystis antarctica cells in surface bloom samples occur in approximately a 2:1 ratio. SAR92 is typically limited by carbon availability and despite carrying proteorhodopsin it does have a photoheterotrophic lifestyle. A close association of SAR92 and Phaeocystis antarctica (with SAR92 possibly contained within the colony liquid matrix) could thus be of mutual benefit. Preliminary findings from a metagenome analysis of the 2010-2011 ASP bloom event indicates that SAR92 and other Phaeocystis associated bacterial taxa may play a role in sulfur metabolism and iron acquisition via ferrochelatase and siderophore production (Delmont et al., in prep.). SAR92 was abundantly present in phytoplankton bloom samples following a natural occurrence of iron-enrichment in the Southern Ocean. This would be especially beneficial if Phaeocystis antarctica would harbor SAR92 within its colony matrix. The fact that this matrix resembles an enclosed aqueous environment allows for rapid diffusion of these secreted compounds and hence efficient usage.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC3695297_P022,"Comparison of the taxonomic affiliation of SSU cDNA derived from subglacial sediment, surface snow and cryoconite communities reveal distinct differences among the communities (Figure 3; Supplementary Tables 1–3). In general, the cryoconite and subglacial sediment SSU cDNA communities were most similar, with pronounced differences noted between these assemblages and the assemblages associated with snow. In particular, the abundance of eukaryal sequences affiliated with Chlamydomonas sp., an alga, in the surface snow (67% of total) and cryoconite (40% of total) but not the subglacial sediment is consistent with previous hypotheses suggesting that subglacial assemblages are supported by chemical energy while surface communities are supported primarily by light energy. Sequences affiliated with the green alga Ulotrichales were detected in both the SSU cDNA and rDNA fraction of the cryoconite assemblage, but only in the rDNA fraction of the subglacial sediment assemblage. This may indicate the subglacial environment receives exogenous material from the surface, such has been demonstrated in a separate Canadian Arctic glacial system using DNA-based fingerprinting methods. However, the physical characteristics of the environment (for example, lack of available light) are likely to preclude activity of this phototrophic population, which may explain the lack of detectable sequences affiliated with this taxon in the cDNA fraction.

PMC7785989_P027,"Microalgae adapted to cold environments might be stressed at temperatures above the optimum. This stress may be reflected on its macromolecular composition, as in the case of Chlamydomonas malina which synthesized high lipid and carbohydrate content at 8 and 15°C, even under nutrient replete conditions (+N). This phenomenon is unusual and remarkable since normally microalgal cells respond to nutrient sufficiency conditions by synthesizing the cellular building blocks proteins, as observed in Chlamydomonas malina cultivated at 4°C. However, at 8 and 15°C, in both +N and −N conditions, the protein content was lower compared to the high lipid and carbohydrate content, suggesting a stress condition caused by temperature. Therefore, nitrogen stress did not cause an effect on the biochemical composition of the cells at 8 and 15°C, but it caused the usual phenomenon of lipid accumulation at 4°C under nitrogen deprivation (−N), as observed in many mesophilic algae in nitrogen-deprived cultivations. Also, at higher temperatures (8 and 15°C), cells mainly synthesized neutral lipids (TAG), probably as a consequence of stress. However, cells cultivated at 4°C and +N conditions mainly synthesized PUFA in the polar fraction (cellular membrane). The reason is that PUFA are essential to keep the fluidity of the membrane at low temperatures. Especially, polyunsaturated and short-chain length fatty acids, such as C16:4n-3 which was found in high concentrations in Chlamydomonas malina. This C16:4n-3 acyl group is nearly exclusively present in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) –the most abundant membrane lipid in Chlamydomonas chloroplast– and is known to be a significant contributor in the transition from liquid-crystalline to gel phase. It is hypothesized that the availability of C16:4n-3 affects the total amount of the prevalent MGDG molecular species that contains C18:3n-3 in the sn-1 and C16:4n-3 in the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. It is still unknown why C16:4n-3 is primarily present in MGDG and how its abundance is regulated in this membrane galactolipid. Therefore, it has been suggested that loss-of-function studies with mutants entirely lacking (or decreased amounts) 16:4n-3 could be interesting to possibly answer what are the specific roles of this molecular species of MGDG in the photosynthetic membrane. Similar to our findings, the same classes of fatty acids were found in the polar microalga and closest Chlamydomonas malina relative, UWO 241. Cells of Chlamydomonas malina cultivated at 4°C responded in a similar way to other algal species when they were cultivated at +N conditions by stimulating the synthesis of proteins, and to −N conditions by accumulating lipids and carbohydrates, and reducing nitrogen-rich compounds like proteins.

PMC6609704_P017,"Historically, deep-rough mutants are known to be resistant to several bacteriophages1,15, in line with recent screenings of the Escherichia coli Keio mutants collection based on phage resistance detection13–15. For the sake of illustration, Qimron et al. identified 11 mutants resistant to phage T7 from the 3985 tested mutants13. Among them, 9 mutants with altered LPS biosynthesis were isolated. Following a similar strategy, Maynard et al. identified 57 mutants, including 8 rfa-mutants, with reduced infectivity to phage lambda14. It is a priori well accepted that LPS recognition by the phage receptor is essential for phage adsorption to Gram-negative host cell. However, some studies suggested that LPS play a non-determining role in the process leading to cell infection by phage15,34 and that the sole LPS truncation cannot explain the significant levels of resistance observed for deep-rough mutants. Starting from this observation, several authors considered the possible reduction of OMPs, also commonly acting as receptors for phages35, as the origin of enhanced resistance to phage infection15,36. However, to the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has never been clearly validated. It is here elegantly supported by our iTRAQ data and enrichment analysis procedure as reported in Figs 8 and 9. Indeed, mutants JW3596 and JW3601 show an enrichment score of 3.82 and 2.64 on GO term detection/response to virus, which corresponds, for JW3596, to 4 OMPs (FhuA, BtuB, OmpF, NrfA) among the 70 differentially abundant proteins and, for JW3601, to 3 OMPs (FhuA, BtuB, FadL) among the 49 we identified (Fig. 9). Strain JW3606 does not pass the minimum enrichment score for this term as only 1 OMP (FhuA) matches among the 44 differentially abundant proteins. Protein FhuA (also called TonA), that is 2.4 times less abundant in JW3606 strain and more than 6 times less present in JW3596 and JW3601 compared to WT, is the receptor of T7, T5, T1, ϕ80, UC-1 and many other Escherichia coli phages isolated from nature37. In the study by Qimron et al., the three deep-rough mutants termed waaC, waaR and waaG (which corresponds to our JW3596, JW3601 and JW3606, respectively) were found resistant to phage T713. They also highlighted that mutants JW3596 and JW3601 have a level of resistance higher than that of the JW3606 mutant, which is in good agreement with the lower content of the FhuA-phage receptor evidenced by our data. In the same way, Trojet et al. tested efficiencies of T4 Superfamily Phages on Escherichia coli Keio strains with single deletion of genes coding for known phage receptors38. They found very similar resistance profiles for JW3606 (ΔrfaG) and JW0146 (ΔfhuA) to PST, SV76, RB51 and RB69 phages in agreement with similar level of FhuA abundance. However, due to a lack of literature data, such correlations could not be established with BtuB, NrfA, FadL and OmpF, which are protein receptors of the bacteriophages BF2339, N440, T241 and K2042. The nanomechanical properties of the knock-out mutants as compared to those pertaining to WT (Figs 5 and 6) are also in line with enhanced resistance of JW3596, JW3601 and JW3606 to phage infection. Indeed, the larger Young modulus measured for the envelopes of these mutants and their larger inner turgor pressures likely limits any deep perforation of the whole cell envelope and/or ejection of DNA from tailed phage into bacteria cytosol compartment during the infection process, and thereby contribute to increase resistance pattern. The predominant role of internal cell turgor pressure in phage DNA ejection was previously demonstrated by several authors43–45. Finally, the analysis of the respective electrokinetic responses of WT and of the mutants reveals that their common electrostatic surface properties cannot explain any differentiated capacities to bind (negatively charged) viruses and, in turn, cannot account for the reported enhanced resistance of the mutants compared to WT cells. These elements illustrate the different implications of gene mutations not only in terms of OMP composition, but also in terms of change in the nanomechanical properties of the cell envelopes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

Similarly, ET can play an opposite role in other plant species, such as rice seedlings, in which this hormone seems to negatively regulate tolerance to salinity51. Lastly, there are ecological concerns that need to be addressed before considering large-scale field application. For instance, ACC amendments in soils potentially influence the physiology of surrounding plants and can be utilised by undesirable plants, such as weeds. Hence, we suggest that field trials are conducted including a range of crops cultivated under different conditions to confirm our results and more importantly, the impact of edaphic factors should be assessed.

Figure 3 shows that on an agar plate containing mannitol the most competitive strain on bean, cowpea and siratro, Burkholderia phymatum, was more mucoid compared to the other five strains, suggesting an increased EPS production. This difference among the tested strains is visible even after a longer incubation of the plates (6 days). In addition, Burkholderia phymatum was also able to swim; in fact, it was the second-best swimmer after Burkholderia sabiae (Figure 4). While Burkholderia mimosarum’s swimming ability was about one third of that of Burkholderia sabiae, the other three strains – Burkholderia diazotrophica, Burkholderia symbiotica and Burkholderia tuberum – were drastically impaired in their swimming capabilities compared to Burkholderia sabiae.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC6953654_P009,"We surveyed open and sparsely vegetated areas of emergent sandbars during the plover and tern breeding season (April–August) in search of nests. We located nests by grid‐searching potential nesting habitat, using spotting scopes to look for incubating birds, and recognizing behavioral cues of adult birds (e.g., territorial and distraction displays). Upon discovery, we logged each nest location with a handheld GPS unit (Trimble Geo XT, Trimble Navigation, Ltd.). Geographic coordinates had a horizontal accuracy of ±15 cm. We floated the eggs to estimate developmental stage and calculate the expected hatch date. We attempted to check each nest every 2 days throughout the incubation period to determine nest fate, increasing our visit frequency within 3 days of the estimated hatch date when possible. If we observed ≥1 chicks or if ≥1 eggs disappeared within 2 days of the estimated hatch date without material evidence of failure (e.g., eggs washed out of nest bowl, predator tracks at nest, bloody eggshell), we considered a nest successful. When no obvious signs of failure were present, but eggs disappeared >2 days before estimated hatch date, we considered the nest failed due to unknown cause. Common causes of plover and tern nest failure are depredation, flooding, weather‐related events such as heavy rain or hail, sandbar erosion, and abandonment. Potential nest predators in this region included raccoons (Procyon lotor), coyotes (Canis latrans), American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), and American mink.

PMC4784014_P003,"There are knowledge gaps and relatively few studies addressing the direct effects of elevated CO2 on elasmobranchs. A reason for the paucity may be because elasmobranchs are not expected to be physiologically vulnerable to elevated CO2. The animals that would eventually become modern elasmobranchs evolved ∼420 million years ago, when atmospheric CO2 was eight to 10 times greater than it is today. Therefore, it is thought that elasmobranchs (like the bony fishes) already possess the HCO3− exchange mechanisms necessary to regulate acid–base/ions efficiently in the presence of CO2 levels similar to those predicted for the end of the century. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated numerous negative effects of elevated CO2 on elasmobranchs. Dixson et al. found that in conditions of elevated CO2, smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) did not respond to odour cues indicative of food, suggesting that food foraging may be affected in some elasmobranchs. This finding is also supported in the mesopredator Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), in which elevated CO2 negatively affected hunting behaviour (via olfaction) as well as growth and metabolic efficiency. Negative effects of elevated CO2 (pH 7.5) and warmer temperatures (+3°C above average) have been documented in pre- and post-hatching survival of brown-banded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) embryos as well. Temperate water little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) embryos also increase their cost of activity and development time and reduce body condition when reared in elevated CO2 (pH 7.7) and at temperatures that are 3–5°C above average.

PMC3348665_P034,"When considering PRMT-scores for the metabolites on the pathway for chitin degradation (Figure 5), a pattern for chitin catabolism was evident. Relative turnover of chitin was highest in April, concurrent with the spring bloom of chitin-synthesizing diatoms in the Western English Channel. Increased turnover of chitin in spring leads to a predicted relative increase in the synthesis of chitobiose and increased consumption of GlcNac, ultimately yielding increased relative synthesis of chitin's breakdown products, Fructose-6P, acetate, and ammonia. Relative abundance of measured concentrations of ammonia had a strong negative correlation with PRMT-scores for GlcNAc. This indicates that when the environmental capacity for the consumption of GlcNAc was increased, the relative synthesis of ammonia was also increased. This was consistent with the reactants and products in the chemical equation for Figure 5. The PRMT-scores for GlcNAc had a strong positive correlation with the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria, members of which are involved in decomposition of organic materials such as chitin. The PRMT-scores predicted an increase in the turnover of chitin, concurrent with spring diatom bloom and with increase in relative abundance of bacterial Phyla predicted to possess the capacity for chitin degradation.

Fungi in ecosystems commonly exposed to drought may be more likely to possess traits conferring tolerance to water stress. They may be more likely to respond positively to dry conditions than would fungi from wetter habitats. We also note that relatively short decomposition time in this experiment may have limited changes in DNA composition, and that RNA composition could have been more responsive in this time frame. Nevertheless, in a simultaneous companion experiment examining N fertilization in the same ecosystem, we observed changes in DNA composition in response to plot environment, microbe origin, and litter origin over this identical time frame. Another issue to consider is that, to be conservative, we restricted our analyses to functional genes that were well-annotated in fungi/eukaryotes. This narrow focus means that our analysis covers only a small fraction of reads from the sample. Thus, it is challenging to determine the ecological significance of increases in these small fractions.

PMC6359870_P012,"Regardless of the mechanism used to maintain the virus within the host during lysogeny, the effect of phage on host phenotype has been extensively studied in important pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio harveyi, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes (reviewed in (Table 1). However, relatively few studies into lysogeny in marine host-virus model systems have been performed. When Yu and colleagues isolated a Pseudoalteromonas strain from Arctic sea ice containing a filamentous phage, they noticed it had lower growth rates and cell density, and lower tolerance of NaCl and reactive oxygen species than when it was cured of the infection. Transcriptional analysis showed downregulation of succinyl-CoA synthetase and succinate dehydrogenase indicating virally-mediated suppression of central carbon metabolism. However, presence of the phage increased host motility. They postulated that the presence of the phage increased host fitness during the nutrient-limited polar winters by slowing down host metabolism and increasing its capacity to find new nutrient sources in the heterogeneous structure of the sea ice in which it lived. Using metagenomic analyses, Brum and colleagues postulated that a similar mechanism increased host fitness in Antarctic bacterial communities during times of low nutrients and explained an observed seasonal prevalence of lysogeny prior to the summer blooms. The underpinning mechanisms are possibly similar to those observed in the Escherichia coli phage λ. This lysogen maintains integration in the host genome via a phage-encoded repressor known as cI. cI also represses the host gene pckA, which encodes a protein for the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate. Thus, lysogeny results in a decoupling of central carbon metabolism from cellular synthesis, reducing host growth rate and potentially conferring a selective advantage in hosts within nutrient-poor environments. Integration of the viral genome into the host genome can interrupt metabolic genes and effectively act as regulatory mechanisms, either at the level of the individual cell by repeated integration and excision, or at the population level by non-reversible lysogeny suppressing genes in a subpopulation. Although there are no known examples of the former in marine bacteria, viruses infecting the cyanobacteria Anabena spp. and Nostoc spp. appear to regulate nitrogen-fixation through active lysogeny. Here, prophages interrupting N-fixation genes (nifD, fdxN and hupL) are excised from the genome during N-limitation, re-activating the genes (reviewed in. Many metabolic genes identified in viral metagenomes are predicted to confer a selective advantage to hosts including sulfur oxidation genes and genes associated with adaptation to high-pressures associated with depth. One study of viral metagenomes from hydrothermal vents identified virally-encoded genes associated with pyrimidine, alanine, aspartate, glutamine, nitrogen, amino and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Pathway analysis suggested that viral AMGs allowed for branched metabolic pathways to alternative products that would provide additional metabolic flexibility to the host, thus increasing host fitness.",viruses,Anabena spp.,infect,parasitism,Viruses,Anabaena,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,TRUE,,NA
PMC4351107_P014,"We did not detect homologs encoding stress-responsive LHCSR/LHCX families or green plant-type LHCA/LHCB protein families. This result is consistent with a hypothesis proposed by Niyogi and Truong, who suggested that a stress-responsive Lhcsr/Lhcx family was lost in the common ancestor of extant dinoflagellates. Although another stress-related LHC protein, called PSBS, which contains four trans-membrane helices, has been shown to play a major role in light energy dissipation in the streptophyte green plant lineage, no PSBS homologs were found in Symbiodinium minutum. Moreover, it remains controversial how dinoflagellates cope with high light stress caused by excess light energy absorbed by chlorophylls and other photosynthetic pigments. Reynolds et al. presented a model wherein the dissociation of PCPs from the photosystems attached to LHCs could achieve high light energy dissipation, and Kanazawa et al. provided evidence that PCP was not detached from photosystems and, instead, LHC itself functioned as a light energy quencher. It is also important for Symbiodinium to acclimate its light-harvesting systems to the high light under elevated temperature, which is proposed to be a physiological factor triggering coral bleaching. Recently, the functional roles of the major carotenoid species in Symbiodinium for photoprotection of the reaction center, namely, peridinin and diatoxanthin/diadinoxanthin, were questioned by spectroscopic analysis. In diatoms, which possess fucoxanthin as a major light-harvesting carotenoid instead of the peridinin found in dinoflagellates, it has been shown that multiple Lhcsr/Lhcx genes are present in the nuclear genomes and encode LHCX proteins playing a key role in photoprotection. Given the presence of Lhcsr/Lhcx genes in other algal lineages, such as brown algae and chromerids, dinoflagellates may have developed a unique strategy to maintain the photoprotection machinery. Future studies exploring stress responses via LHC expression might explain the absence of Lhcsr/Lhcx gene family in dinoflagellates; LHCSR/LHCXs in the ancestral dinoflagellates might have been taken over by independently evolved stress-responsive LHCs and lost during evolution.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC8200792_P034,"A sequential UV treatment, with and without the addition of H2O2, followed by free chlorine MS2 disinfection was studied by Cho et al. in organic-free water. No synergy was recorded for the treatment by UV irradiation followed by free chlorine, while increased inactivation was found when H2O2 was added in the primary UV disinfection step. In this case, a significant synergy was recorded since an additional 1.5-log inactivation was added to the 2 logs occurring by UV treatment and free chlorine. The synergistic effect was based on the additional inactivation achieved during the primary UV disinfection step due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals during H2O2 photolysis, and also on the microbial injury during the primary step which facilitated the subsequent secondary chlorine disinfection. Overall the addition of H2O2 in the primary step, and thus the conversion of the UV process to an AOP, could significantly enhance the efficiency of UV/free chlorine sequential disinfection processes. Similarly, a UV/H2O2-Cl2 integrated flow through system was assessed by Chu et al. for MS2 disinfection. A 5.78 log abatement was achieved at a flow rate at 50 L/h (corresponding to a hydraulic retention time HRT = 7 s), while a 4.49 log removal was achieved at a flow rate of 100 L/h (HRT = 36 s) Mamane et al. studied the virucidal efficiency of a UV/H2O2 system on MS2, T4 and T7 phages, filtering out UV radiation between 200 and 295 nm in order to i) limit the effect of direct UV photolysis, and ii) isolate the effect of hydroxyl radicals. Authors reported that bacteriophages T4 in phosphate buffered saline were sensitive to irradiation > 295 nm in the absence of H2O2, nonetheless, MS2 was very resistant. Overall, sensitivity decreased in the order: T4 > T7 > MS2, with MS2 suffering no inactivation at wavelengths > 295 nm. Interestingly, the addition of 25 mg/L H2O2 under UV irradiation for 15 min resulted in 2.5-logs of MS2 inactivation, had a small additional effect on T7 inactivation (of 1 log), but it did not result in any additional T4 disinfection. To investigate dye-virus interactions, Timchak and Gitis used various combinations of phages (MS2, φX174 and T4) and fluorescent dyes (rhodamine B and fluorescein) to study inactivation and degradation processes. Authors found that viral abatement was not affected by the presence of dyes but the addition of 0.2 M H2O2 at 70 mJ/cm2 UV dose enhanced MS2 abatement by two logs; however, peroxide addition was found to have no effect on φX174 and T4 phages. The presence of viruses caused the reduction of the bleaching of fluorescent dyes presumably due to restricted availability of hydroxyl radicals and their preferential involvement in virus inactivation. In another study, Bounty et al. focused on the improvement of UV adenovirus abatement with the addition of hydrogen peroxide. A UV dose of approximately 200 mJ/cm2 from a low-pressure source emitting at 253.7 nm was needed for a 4-log reduction of adenovirus without peroxide. The addition of 10 mg/L H2O2 was capable of achieving a 4-log viral abatement at a reduced dose of 120 mJ/cm2.

PMC5380433_P004,"We used the rare isotope 34S as a tracer to follow the exchange of sulfur between marine micro-organisms at the single-cell level. Symbiodinium cells were incubated for 18 days in artificial seawater containing 34S-labelled sulfate as the sole sulfur source (34S-ASW; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We relied exclusively on the Symbiodinium cellular machinery to biosynthesise and exude 34S-labelled DMSP following incubation with the 34S-sulfate precursor. To prevent direct uptake of 34S-sulfate by bacteria, all Symbiodinium cultures were rinsed thoroughly and re-inoculated into ASW containing sulfate in natural isotopic abundance (natS-ASW) before addition of bacterial cells. Two different bacterial strains were added to the rinsed cultures and co-incubated for six hours: (i) Pseudovibrio sp. P12, a DMSP-degrading bacterium isolated from healthy corals, selected because of its worldwide distribution in coastal waters and its abundance in benthic invertebrate communities; and (ii) a control, Escherichia coli W (ATCC 9637), a widely studied and fully sequenced strain, able to grow in seawater and not capable of degrading DMSP. To precisely localise bacterial cells, both strains were pre-grown in a medium enriched in the rare stable isotope 15N (in amino-acids and ammonium form). The cellular incorporation of the stable isotope tracers (34S and 15N) was identified by an increase in the sulfur (34S/32S) and/or nitrogen (15N/14N) ratio above their natural abundance values (0.043 and 0.0037, respectively).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC8145042_P010,"In the early 2000s, with the growing antibiotic resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to two bactericidal compounds, isoniazid and rifampicin, fluoroquinolines had become the most common new antibiotic therapy to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. In 2001, Montero et al. identified a gene mfpA that encoded a PRP that conferred a new mechanism of fluoroquinoline resistance to Mycobacterium smegmatis. The protein encoded by the mfpA gene resulted in a low level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacine. Hegde et al. identified a 183-amino acid MfpA homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtMfpA) encoded by the Rv3361c gene that was 67% identical to the 192-residue Mycobacterium smegmatis MfpA protein. In 2005, Hegde et al. reported the three-dimensional structure of MfpA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealing it to be a PRP made up of eight complete PR coils composed of a mixture of type II and type IV β turns (Figure 4). MfpA was the first PRP to have its three-dimensional structure solved. Hegde et al. reported that MfpA expression in vivo conferred resistance to the antibiotic fluoroquinolone. Fluoroquinolines are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs that interfere with DNA replication in bacteria, leading to bacterial cell death. Fluoroquinolines exert their antibacterial activity by interfering with the normal function of the type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV. These enzymes normally cut the genomic DNA to allow supercoiling and then ligate the DNA to stabilize the supercoiled DNA. Fluoroquinoline acts by inhibiting the ligase activity of these enzymes and leaving the nuclease activity intact, resulting in accumulation of single- and double-strand breaks that leads to disrupted DNA replication and cell death. Fluoroquinoline acts by binding reversibly to the gyrase-DNA complexes and stabilizing the covalent enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphate ester that is normally a transient intermediate in the topoisomerase reaction. Hegde et al. reported that the three-dimensional structure of MfpA exhibited a size, shape and electrostatic surface similar to that of B-form DNA, and concluded that its mechanism of action was due to DNA mimicry. Since fluoroquinoline only binds to DNA gyrase-DNA complexes, binding of MfpA to DNA gyrase blocks fluoroquinoline binding to DNA gyrase-DNA complexes, thus interfering with the bactericidal activity of fluoroquinoline.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

The slides were then rinsed with water and spin-dried, and inserted into ArraySlide 24-well frames (The Gel Company). After assembly, a compression-fit gasket acts to physically separate each sub-array. For some experiments, larger frames with 96 wells holding four slides were employed. All transcription-translation reactions were done within the individual wells of these ArraySlide frames. To achieve this, the volume of the cell-free reactions was adjusted to 60 μL and non-ionic detergent, Nonidet P40 (NP-40, Sigma-Aldrich), was included to allow the solution to evenly spread across the bottom of the well, thereby covering the entire area of the sub-array. The Escherichia coli S30 protein reaction consisted of the following amounts of reagents from the RTS 100 Escherichia coli HY Kit (Roche Applied Science, now sold by 5 Prime): 12 μL lysate (S30 extract), 10 μL substrate mix, 12 μL of amino acid mixture (except methionine), 1 μL methionine, and 5 μL of reconstitution buffer. Included in the expression mixture were 0.5 μL (5 units) of T7 RNA polymerase (Fermentas Life Sciences), 0.5 μL of 10% NP-40, and 1 μg of expression plasmid DNA (in water), up to a final volume of 60 μL.

However, it is also important to recognize that among islands and regions there are substantial differences in reef habitats and structure that are likely independent of human impacts, as well as in potentially influential oceanic factors such as wave energy, water temperature, and oceanic productivity that confound our ability to understand what might be considered ‘natural’ for a particular region or reef.

During morphogenesis, the position at which a new appendage is supposed to form is determined and additional body axes, the proximodistal axes, of the new appendages are established. Concurrently dorsoventral and anteroposterior compartments of the primordium are patterned. Despite large morphological differences between body appendages of different phyla, it has been found that homologous or orthologous genes are often involved in similar regulatory processes during body appendage formation. The regulatory gene networks controlling the formation and shaping of body appendages during embryogenesis have so far been studied in detail in dipteran insects and vertebrates only. However, formation and patterning of a vertebrate limb differ in many aspects compared with development of the arthropod leg. Vertebrate limbs are mainly formed by mesodermal tissue, whereas arthropod legs are epidermal structures. Two regions, organizing the growth and patterning of the vertebrate limb, have been described before: the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). A positive feedback interaction between the AER and the ZPA is important for the development of the limb and has no complement mechanism in arthropods. Other differences involve the number of leg elements and joints, the position of skeletal and muscular elements as well as their innervation. All of these differences may, however, be regarded to be apomorphic traits.

PMC5671483_P002,"Virus-host affiliations however are largely established by observing the cytopathic effects of viral infection or by microscopy detection of virion particles. These properties relate to the lytic mode of viral reproduction that has historically remained on focus due to the noxious effects that lysis has on human health, livestock, and agriculture. However, viruses can also frequently endogenize by integration into cellular genomes, sometimes providing useful novel genes to make them evolutionarily competitive. Moreover, many viruses either infect bacterial symbionts of eukaryotic cells or reside as prophages in the genomes of obligate intracellular bacteria that infect a wide range of eukaryotic hosts. These virus-cell interactions are largely non-lytic in nature and because they do not yield the classic phenotypic effects of viral infection, have likely remained underestimated through established methods of virus discovery. Importantly, such interactions blur the traditional concept of “virus host” and raise the possibility of viruses interacting (not necessarily in a lytic manner) and exchanging genetic material simultaneously with more than one superkingdom of life. Bordenstein and Bordenstein recently reported an example of a eukaryotic gene module in bacteriophage WO residing as prophage in the intracellular α-proteobacterium Wolbachia, which infects a large group of insects. In order to produce viral progeny, the bacteriophage WO must neutralize antiviral defense and enter/exit the membranes of both bacterial and eukaryal organisms.

PMC3131602_P020,"Finally, when examining patterns of population differentiation at neutral versus non-neutral loci, it is important to keep in mind that gene flow will not necessarily ensure that non-adaptive genes are continually exchanged between even proximate populations. Although the differentiation of neutral markers is driven primarily by stochastic processes, whereas that of non-netural markers is driven by both selective and stochastic processes (e.g.,, natural selection can also influence the distribution of markers that are neither being directly selected, nor are linked to regions under selection. This arises if divergent selection is sufficiently strong to promote reproductive isolation between populations. In these cases, a reproductive barrier will then create a barrier to gene flow that results in the potentially genome-wide differentiation of populations following genetic drift. This will lead to an inverse correlation between gene flow and the adaptive divergence of populations, and thus a positive association between the phenotypic divergence and neutral molecular genetic differentiation of populations following a pattern that is known as isolation by adaptation (IBA). In other words, populations will not only diverge at adaptive loci as a direct result of selection, but will also diverge at neutral loci as a direct result of drift, which is indirectly a result of selection via a reproductive barrier. This pattern was identified in a semi-natural experiment in which adjacent populations of sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) had diverged from one another as a result of adaptation to different nutrient additions. Genetic differentiation was evident at outlier loci, and also across a wider survey of putatively neutral loci. This was interpreted as evidence that the selection pressures from varying combinations of nutrient additions in different plots was strong enough to cause reproductive isolation between populations, which in turn has led to neutral genetic differentiation as a result of genetic drift. Studies such as this, which have identified candidate adaptive molecular markers, should in the future find it increasingly feasible to take the next step and characterize the phenotypic outcomes of alternative genotypes (Box 3).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

Expert classification of weather systems has been used to deduce the preferred sectors of cyclones and anticyclones for migration.

Even though using SSU rRNA transcripts as a proxy for growth and/or activity has been questioned, here we use the term “active” as meaning a “protein synthesis potential.” It is possible that the amplified SSU amplicon sequences were from dead cells, although a study using propidium monoazide that binds to DNA and inhibits subsequent amplification revealed that most of the cells have an intact cell membrane. This confirmed that lysed cells are rapidly recycled into living biomass in this extremely oligotrophic environment. In addition, that almost all SSU transcripts had a matching 16S rRNA gene amplicon but not vice versa (Fig. 1B), suggested that only a subset of the total microbial community was active at the time of sampling. Finally, that up to 31% of the total SSU rRNA transcripts were not confidently placed onto a reference tree (Fig. 1B and 2) might indicate that those unassigned SSU transcripts could represent novel candidate phyla, known phyla with no sequenced genomes, or could alternatively lack sufficient phylogenetic signal to be placed. Moreover, the greater proportion of unassigned SSU rRNA gene transcripts from the metatranscriptome compared to the 16S rRNA gene amplicons suggested that a large portion of the active prokaryotic community (Eukarya SSU rRNA gene transcripts were removed) was potentially amplified at lower efficiency by standard universal primers and thus was likely overlooked in earlier studies.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

The hexane extract of Cyperus rotundus was effective in reducing the vector species. When compared with the study of Sharma et al., the protective effect against An. Culicifacies, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus, of hexane extracted of Cyperus rotundus seem to be higher than that of neem oil. Selection of a repellent for further development cannot be based on the results of any one test against a single insect because mosquito responses to repellents vary within and among species. The protection against Cx tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, the vectors of Japanese B encephalitis and filariasis, respectively, is considered as satisfactory. The hexane-extracted Cyperus rotundus may protect against other mosquito vector species. The further studies should be investigated against as many different malaria vector as possible under both laboratory and field conditions. Several methods enhancing the efficacy of repellent, such as purification of the active fraction, increase in persistence and duration of repellency need to be studied.",Ocimum americanum,mosquitoes,repel,amensalism,Ocimum americanum,Culicidae,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC6010748_P001,"The long‐term persistence of a species in a given landscape is conditional on the availability of resources at the appropriate temporal and spatial scales. As the resources and their spatial distribution change over time, it is highly likely that species’ distributions change accordingly to track such resources. For instance, the food resources required by a species often vary along the life cycle and among life stages, often associated to spatial changes in food availability. Such changes may be overcome either by species following the resources through different habitats, or by different habitats becoming available at the optimal time for a given species. Both strategies will lead to temporal variation in species diversity and abundance across the landscape, which should be particularly evident for highly vagile organisms such as bats and birds. Understanding such spatiotemporal patterns is paramount for conservation, due to the need of protecting all habitats providing the resources to fulfill species’ requirements across the whole year.

They also suggested that the relationships between non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and microbiota deserved more investigation in order to unravel their mutual role in influencing the host immune system and related processes. Bacteria might release some soluble factors other than toxins or other peptides that could function as a “communication vector” and small RNAs within the OMVs might be one of these vectors. Moreover, their data demonstrate that the RNA found in OMVs aligned to some of the host chromosomes, thus leading to the conclusion that OMVs might be able to affect epigenetic processes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

While PAK_P3 induces a progressive depletion of host transcripts that eventually represent only 13% of non-ribosomal RNAs in the cell 13 min post infection, PAK_P4 is much more rapid as only 20% of the total transcripts matches the host genome as soon as 3.5 min post infection (Figure 2).

Along each transect we laid a string, and selected the first patch for each type of EE (namely, cushion, tussock, and shrub) and bare soil intersected by the string, so that we selected along each transect a cushion, a shrub, a tussock, and an area with bare soil. We selected EE patches at a distance no less than 10 m from each other to prevent relevés from being mutually influenced. Average distance between the nearest starting points of transects was about 250 m. In each of them we recorded the nurse species, measured the maximum length (measured along the direction of maximum spread) and width (measured orthogonally to the direction of maximum length) of its canopy, and counted the individuals of each species, including seedlings of the considered nurse species. We counted individuals found inside the patch, namely inside the area occupied by a cushion or under the shrub or tussock canopy, as well as at the patch border and inside a buffer of 20 cm from the patch border. Approximating the shape of each patch to an ellipse, we calculated the area occupied by each patch by the formula S = π a b, where a and b are the semi-major axis (patch length divided by two) and the semi-minor axis (patch width divided by two), respectively. On bare soil (surface outside any engineered patch, whose living plant cover percentage did not exceed 10%, without outcropping rock cover and with possible occurrence of dead matter), we counted the individuals of each species in a circular plot of 0.5 m in radius and distant at least 1 m from the closest engineered patch.

PMC4251444_P002,"The Pf4 phage, which has a genome comprised of 12 Kbp, is a member of the Inoviridae and is closely related to ssDNA phage such as M13 and fd. Such phage are continuously secreted by the bacterial host without cell lysis. The effect of the Pf4 phage on biofilm development and variant formation is linked to the establishment of a superinfection (SI) variant of the Pf4 phage. The SI phage are able to form plaques on the wild-type (WT) host, which is otherwise immune to reinfection by the non-SI phage. Additionally, we have recently shown through deep sequencing of the biofilm dispersal population that the phage accumulates mutations at a significantly higher frequency than the rest of the PAO1 genome, suggesting that superinfection is linked to mutations in the Pf4 prophage. Because the formation of the SI phage is an integral part of the biofilm development life-cycle, it is likely that the establishment of the SI phenotype is the result of biofilm-specific physiology and gene expression.

PMC3468273_P019,"The robustness of the molecular dating analysis by BEAST was evaluated by performing multiple trials using various molecular clock priors (10−9 to 10−6/site/year) and substitution models (HKY, GTR, NT93). Modifying these settings did not significantly alter the final estimated mutation rate for this set of genes (posterior probability, 5 10−7/site/year) or the dating evaluation for the tMRCA. However the 95% HPD range was strongly influenced by priors on the type of variation around the mean mutation clock rate. In bacteria, mutation rate has been estimated for decades in vitro by detecting phenotypic traits that depend on SNPs, such as antibiotic resistance. The in vitro mutation rate for mycoplasmas is similar to that of other bacteria. This finding is surprising since mycoplasmas lack the methylation-mediated DNA repair system commonly found in other bacteria whose genome has not been drastically reduced in size. Mycoplasmas must have found alternative ways to correct errors occurring during DNA replication, putative candidates have recently been identified. Estimates of in vitro mutation rates certainly do not reflect what happens in vivo. However, the new-generation sequencing techniques offer ways to evaluate this parameter, provided multiple strains or isolates are obtained sequentially. Quite surprisingly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis seems to have similar mutation rates during latency periods compared to active disease. The increased rate of mutation during phases of slower replication could be linked to reduced metabolism and DNA repair. Mutation rates estimated in multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus are in the range of 10−5.5/site/year, 10−6/site/year for housekeeping genes of Helicobacter pylori and those of Yersinia pestis in the range of 2.3 10−8 to 2.9 10−9/site/year.

PMC7718246_P026,"Soil TP in the 0–100 cm soil profile with HD was significantly higher than seen for the other three degradation levels (Fig. 4b), which falsified part of our first hypothesis about soil TP dynamics, but still confirmed our third hypothesis about vertical change of soil TP dynamics. In the process of plant growth, phosphorus in soil is absorbed for root growth2. With the decrease of vegetation biomass (Table 1), the content of phosphorus absorbed decreases66, thereby increasing the content of TP in soil. Additionally, rodent damage is a serious problem for heavily degraded wet meadows67. In the process of burrowing, rodents destroy the original structure of the soil68, thereby increasing soil temperature, and reducing the water content of the soil layer. This may cause serious water stress for microbial activities and thus reduce microbial activity. As a result, the mineralization and decomposition rate of soil phosphorus decreased with the decrease of soil microbial activity69, and ultimately could result in an accumulation of TP in the soil of the HD plot. However, the mechanism of building up a higher TP in the soil of the CK plot is different. The higher TP content of the CK plot originated primarily from litter and root exudates70, where the return of residue P to the soil is much greater than the P absorbed by plants to support their growth. Studies have shown that when soil TP becomes the limiting factor, plant root exudates ionize H+ through organic acids or activate insoluble inorganic P in the soil through exchange and reduction to increase the biological effectiveness of P71. Because the higher organic carbon content of CK soil provides sufficient energy for microorganisms, the higher microbial activity increases the decomposition rate of surface litter. The result is that the phosphorus in the decomposition products of litter is returned to the surface soil by leaching72, and total phosphorus content of CK soil increases further.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

We also found that the loosening of the SH is not substantial, and the uniformity of the NH and global leaf herbivory variability suggests the prevalence of LHH. Although plant growth and herbivore activity should obey general biological and ecological rules, we speculate that other influential factors are more important than climatic factors, for example, biodiversity pattern or different intrinsic biological sensitivity of the trophic level to climatic factors. We urge that studies involving herbivory variability should therefore pay more attention to the other metrics affecting herbivory, for example, aridity level.

PMC7908490_P026,"Once the innate immune response activates, adaptive response-activated cells produce soluble factors needed for lymphocyte recruitment, activation and differentiation. During inflammation and immunity processes, leukocytes and vascular cells interact closely and cytokines play a really important role in this interaction. Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of cellular injuries and the endogenous anti-oxidant defense can prevent ROS-mediated damage. To elucidate the role of PD in the oxidative stress response, the expression of a set of mRNA codifying for proteins with a pivotal role in the organism antioxidant defense, superoxide dismutase (sod1 and sod2) and catalase (cat), were investigated. SOD is in fact an important endogenous anti-oxidant enzyme that allows a first-line defense against ROS converting O2− in O2 and H2O2, while CAT catalyzes the conversion from H2O2 to O2 and H2O. Owing to their fast diffusion and versatile biological activities, reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are interesting candidates for wound-to-leukocyte signaling. A study using zebrafish, in fact, showed a sustained rise in H2O2 concentration at the wound margin, starting 3 min after wounding and peaking at 20 min. In this regard, a treatment with resveratrol significantly reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in different experimental models and allowed us to hypothesize about a possible similar action exerted by polydatin in reducing ROS production. Indeed, the molecular analysis revealed that PD treatments allow a greater defense against oxidative stress induced by copper sulphate, with consequent lower activation of the inflammatory response. Sod1 and cat expressions were higher when PD was administered following CuSO4 treatment, suggesting a greater beneficial activity as healing rather than as preventive treatment. The difference in expression between the two isoforms of the sod gene can be due to the their different cellular localization, Sod1 being more abundant in cytosol, while sod2 is more abundant in the mitochondria, and suggests that the toxic effects of Cu are mainly neutralized at cytosolic level. In addition, since Sod1 is a Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, we can speculate that its upregulation can be firstly due to an increase of cytoplasmatic Cu concentration. In addition, Interleukin 8 gene (cxcl8b.1) is involved in neutrophil chemotaxis and its expression increases proportionally to ROS concentration. In this light, our data confirm the benefic effect of PD when administered after the organism is injured, since in this experimental group, mRNA levels were similar to those detected in CTRL larvae and a reduction of neutrophils to the damaged site was shown by MPO assay. Catalase activity strongly supports this evidence; in fact, the highest levels are detected in this group, suggesting that the antioxidant machinery activates to fight against copper-induced ROS production.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

This is the simplest form of social organization seen in caterpillar colonies, and communication between colony-mates occurs primarily via construction of the shelter. Many other species are nomadic, and move en masse between food sources and resting sites. Organization of collective locomotion in these species resembles that seen in migrating ungulate herds or fish schools, where individuals use communication to remain together during travel. In this situation, synchronization of behavior is essential to maintain group cohesion, and therefore a collective decision must arise about the timing and direction of travel.

PMC7690428_P013,"OmpA or LPS receptor factors cannot be considered strictly essential to F conjugation since their mutation only decreases transfer efficiency by 2–3 log. Moreover, mating pair stabilization defects can be overridden by performing mating on solid media, suggesting that interactions with OmpA or LPS are needed to stabilize the mating pair formation only in liquid mating. One might then ask, is the F plasmid an exception to the need for recipient factors in some conditions? A recent study in Klebsiella pneumoniae identified the outer membrane OmpK36 homolog of the Escherichia coli outer membrane OmpC as a receptor that mediates conjugation of the IncFII plasmid pKpQIL. As observed in the case of the F plasmid, TraNpKpQIL determines the OmpK36-receptor specificity, while complementing a traNpKpQIL mutant with TraNR100 abolished this dependence, demonstrating that recipient receptors might be highly specific to the transferred plasmid. In addition to the IncF-type, the conjugation process of IncI-type plasmids was also shown to be sensitive to LPS mutations, and interestingly, some LPS mutations that affect IncI plasmid transfer do not impact the entry of the F plasmid, while others affect both types of plasmid. Recently, the PilV adhesin encoded by the IncI1-type plasmid R64 was identified as the donor factor that binds to LPS in the recipient cell. This adhesin is thought to localize to the tip of the thin type IV pilus that is required only in liquid mating conditions, rendering the interaction between PilV and LPS important only under these conditions, as observed for TraN and OmpA or LPS interactions in the case of the F plasmid. In contrast, no such recipient receptors could be identified for the broad host range plasmids RP4 and R388. Indeed, the ompA and LPS recipient mutants, which drastically decrease the efficiency of F conjugation, do not affect RP4 conjugation efficiency.

PMC4324911_P015,"The charged amino acids were enriched in the coevolving residues, suggesting that the interactions mediated by these charged residues are of importance to the functions of HIV-1 proteins. It is universal accepted that the salt bridges in proteins most often arise from the anionic carboxylate (COO-) of negatively charged amino acids (Asp or Glu) and the cationic ammonium/ guanidinium (NH3+ or NHC(NH2)2+) from positively charged amino acids (Lys or Arg). The salt bridges in HIV proteins mediate the critical activities of the virus, such as entry to host cells, replication, and assembly. Salt bridges are of critical importance for host-virus interactions. Wu et al. found that salt bridges formed between HIV entry inhibitors and CCR5 chemokine receptor, which acts as a co-receptor for HIV-1 viral entry, potentially locked the receptor in an inactive conformation. Therefore, the salt bridges mediated by the charged residues in the coevolving residue pairs will be suitable in designing potential anti-HIV drugs. When drugs disrupt a certain salt bridge in HIV-proteins, there will be four possible endings depending on the type of proteins, including structural collapse, inhibition of host-virus interactions, failure of virus assembly, and loss of catalytic activities. These potential mechanisms of the anti-HIV drugs can be validated by solid experimental evidence, which will be set forth as below. For envelope glycoprotein gp120, two detected coevolving residue pairs (LYS231-GLU267, and LYS231-GLU268) might be involved in the formation of salt bridges. The structural analysis validated that these two interactions were within 5 Å and they together with other coevolving residues formed a protein sector in the inner domain, which was recently proven critical for CD4-required conformational transitions in the HIV-1 Env trimer. For Reverse transcriptase, there are three opposite charged coevolving residue pairs, including Asp67-Lys70, Glu28-Lys32, and Asp67-Lys219, which was located near (within 10 Å) the three catalytically essential amino acid residues (Asp110, Asp185, and Asp186) for polymerase catalysis. We presume that the salt bridges formed by these residue pairs play critical roles in maintaining the stability of the catalytic sites. A recent study found that Alizarine derivatives as new dual inhibitors of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-associated DNA polymerase and RNase H activities could block the salt bridges by occupying binding pockets near these coevolving residues.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

While information on the mechanisms of belowground neighbor perception is rare, Schmid et al. outline that Arabidopsis roots perceive neighboring roots or their associated microorganisms by a mechanism that involves the induction of pathogenesis-related proteins.

PMC3496868_P061,"Our modeling also applies to pathways besides two-component systems, such as the synthesis of the cytoplasmic second messenger cyclic-di-GMP by diguanylate cyclases and degradation by phosphodiesterases. While fast kinetics are required for gradient formation, localized kinases and phosphatases can also give rise to asymmetries after cytokinesis, solely by segregating localized components. For example, cyclic-di-GMP is asymmetrically distributed in Caulobacter crescentus and Pseudomonas immediately after cell division. Christen et al. suggested that the dephosphorylation activity of the unipolarly localized enzyme PleC is ultimately responsible for lowering cyclic-di-GMP levels in one of the daughter cells by inactivating the diguanylate cyclase PleD, which synthesizes cyclic-di-GMP. Notably, there is no apparent asymmetry in cyclic-di-GMP levels prior to the completion of division, thus our modeling results predict that in this scenario PleD must be deactivated at a rate not significantly larger than the inverse diffusive timescale, thus requiring cell division to give rise to the asymmetry.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

While δ34S fractionation rates of jellyfish has not been reported so far, the strong shift to lower δ34S values of Aurelia aurita over time may suggest a dietary shift from strictly pelagic to benthic food sources. We were unable to analyze gut contents to support this hypothesis; however, our mixing model results would be consistent with a switch from pelagic mesozooplankton as the main carbon source to benthic microplankton (e.g., protozoan) and/or resuspended organic particles from the benthos over the course of 4 months.

required to separate two strains into different species when the 16S rDNA sequence similarity
between two strains is over the threshold (97.0% or 98.7–99.0%) separating two species. DDH is still
considered as a gold standard for species description, but is tedious and cumbersome. In
addition, the genome DNA-DNA similarity values of DDH show a very high variation among
experiments and among laboratories. Therefore, a
group known as the Ad Hoc Committee for the Re-evaluation of Species Definition in
Bacteriology has suggested the development and validation of alternatives to DDH. Among several studies for exploiting alternative
methods that are highly reproducible and compatible with DDH, it has been reported that the
nucleotide sequence similarity of three housekeeping genes—i.e., recN

polymerase) and thdF (encoding a GTPase)—between strains can be used to
deduce whole genome DNA-DNA similarity, and it has therefore been proposed that these genes be

Since the publication of the ISO/CEN 15216–1 method for virus detection, countries and even private companies have begun to implement virus testing in food. For routine testing an approach such as metabarcoding can be performed on nucleic acid extracts obtained using the ISO method and can be of interest to characterize the contaminant strains. This can be of special interest for example for norovirus as some strains differ in their ability to cause disease. However, full genome or long sequence characterization and/or agnostic approach will be essential either to trace the contaminating event or to identify emerging variants or viruses. In the case of food-related outbreaks, identification of all viral strains present in the sample may help to prevent further disease in humans (for example in a case of a sample with co-contamination of norovirus and hepatitis A virus). Being able to identify the different viruses, and eventually other micro-organisms such as bacteria may help to understand the impact of a combination of pathogens in observed disease. The methods and results described above are mostly based on Illumina sequencing.

For example, in Bacillus subtilis, frameshift mutations in a poly(A) HT at the 5'end of swrA occur at high frequency, roughly 10-4 and 10-5 for a base pair deletion (9 to 8 bp) and insertion (8 to 9 bp), respectively. A Campylobacter coli poly(T) HT at the 5'end of flhA showed a deletion frequency of 3 × 10-4 (T8 → T7) and an insertion frequency of 7 × 10-6 (T7 → T8). In Mycoplasma hominis, a 5'poly(A) HT in vaa-2 is associated with phase variation of the Vaa antigen. The switching frequency between the Vaa+ (HT with 8 bp) and Vaa- (HT with 7 bp) phenotypes was estimated as 10-3 to < 10-4. In our model, the Listeria monocytogenes inlA 5' HT, we observed a frequency of insertion of an adenine in the A6 tract (A6 → A7) in the order of 10-7, while the frequency of an adenine deletion in this HT (A7 ->A6) was lower, suggesting that mutation events that lead to reversion to a full length inlA are more common in this HT. Further examples of HTs involved in phase variation include a poly(A) HT at the 5'end of the Mycoplasma fermentans p78 gene, which encodes the ABC transporter subunit p78. In this HT, deletion of one adenine in the 7-base tract was shown to result in inactivation of the gene. Frameshift mutations in a 5' poly(G) HT in flhB from Pseudomonas putida have also been described. Interestingly, our data showed that Helicobacter pylori is the only species in our dataset with overrepresentation of poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(T) HTs with 3 to 8 bases. Consistent with this observation, there are many examples of Helicobacter pylori genes that are phase variable due to indels in HTs. For example, Tannaes et al. reported a poly(G) HT involved in phase variation of Helicobacter pylori pldA, which encodes the phospholipase A.

PMC8271383_P001,"Salt marshes are ecologically sensitive ecosystems that connect the terrestrial and marine environments and serve as critical habitats for flora and fauna. Salt marshes are negatively impacted by anthropogenic exploitation in the form of coastal development and natural resource extraction. Disturbances cause irreversible alterations in the condition of salt marsh communities over time. Sea-level rise, drought, and physical alteration in soils, as well as changes in hydrological patterns, exert major pressures on salt marsh ecosystems. Disturbances in salt marshes negatively impact soil structure, which is one of the main components of coastal wetlands and responsible for the high primary production of coastal marshes. Bulk density increases due to disturbances accelerating organic matter degradation, compaction, and erosion, and as a result, soil volume decreases. Compaction yields an increase in the fraction of soil pores filled with water at a constant moisture content level as the average pore size decreases. An increase in soil bulk density changes the soil aeration properties, alters soil biological processes due to a decrease in soil temperature, expedites the soil denitrification process, causes loss in the mycorrhizal fungi community, and restricts the vegetation root growth. Bulk density is typically measured for characterizing soil structure and utilized for measuring total porosity. Bulk density reflects soil’s structural stability to support vegetation growth against the destructive impacts of tidal flooding; however, bulk density greater than 1.6 g/cm3 is not suitable for root and plant growth in salt marshes. Studies have shown that an increase in soil bulk density from 1.1 to 1.4 g/cm3 yielded a 42% reduction in oxygen diffusion rate through waterlogged salt marsh soil, while the induced changes in soil bulk density from 1.1 to 1.7 g/cm3 resulted in a 75% reduction in the rate of oxygen diffusion.

Some studies observed that during a bloom 40–60% of the cells reaching the hypolimnion were still viable. It would therefore appear that in the absence of parasites the majority of algal production is lost by sinking and is unavailable to support higher trophic levels. In the eutrophic Lake Aydat, the cyanobacteria production was so high that even parasitism could not help channel high rates of this carbon to higher trophic levels (i.e., zooplankton) and the carbon loss due to sedimentation of microphytoplankton still accounted for 57.7% of the total.

Unlike compensatory mutations, generally beneficial mutations contribute to an increase in fitness, regardless of the genetic background in which they arise. In this scenario, resistant populations overcome the cost of resistance by adapting to general environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability and the presence of stressors. The dominant view that has emerged from studies of the long-term evolution of antibiotic-resistant populations is that adaptation to the cost of resistance is driven by compensatory mutations. Compensatory mutations have been identified in clinical pathogen populations, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and compensatory adaptation has emerged as a central explanation for the long-term maintenance of resistance in pathogen populations.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

Our study had limited spatial replication (particularly at low habitat quality), but nevertheless improves understanding of how disturbance and habitat quality structure long‐term productivity dynamics. Spatial variation in habitat quality is rarely accounted for in estimates of macroalgal NPP, but is critically important when generalising within and among ecosystems. Likewise, while our disturbance plots were relatively large, they could not perfectly emulate widespread canopy loss and may have been partly influenced by the surrounding unmanipulated kelp forest. Neighbouring giant kelp may have reduced current velocities in disturbance plots, but probably had little effects on nutrient delivery, wave attenuation or light availability (because of our sampling design); canopy removal plots were also unlikely to have attracted mobile fish and invertebrate consumers from the surrounding kelp forest.

In the case of Daphnia, phosphorus assimilation is often set to 1, while carbon is 0.6 and decreases to almost zero with increasing seston C:P ratio. Laboratory experiments have shown that regeneration of nutrients can be calculated with high accuracy at low and high food quality, but most of them refer to Daphnia species. Sterner et al. present a striking example of linking the classical trophic cascade to stoichiometric‐driven effects in food webs, where a shift from large cladocerans (low N: P) to copepods (high N: P) caused a shift from P to N limitation for autotrophs. Thus, seston quality is very important for zooplankton, their community composition, nutrient cycling, and efficiency of transfer of energy and matter. In summer, the proportion of inedible phytoplankton increases while food quality decreases, thus negatively affecting zooplankton development. Therefore, it is especially important to understand how such mismatches between primary producers and consumers affects the transfer of essential substances in planktonic food webs. For this reason, we investigated the transfer of carbon, nutrients, and PUFAs through plankton communities in 30 lakes with different trophic status in the middle of the summer stagnation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

It is difficult to evaluate what the direct consequences of not removing 63 t of C daily in the form of bacteria and organic matter would be. Probably, the bottom water of that entire zone would be more anoxic, since the metabolism of bacteria is faster and more oxygen consuming than that of the sponges, which is among the lowest for filter-feeding invertebrates36.

The tentative comparison between the filtering performance of sponges and equivalent human systems reveals the enormous energetic and economic cost that the removal of bacteria and DOC would involve if carried out by humans. In addition to C utilization, the sponge biomass has a daily uptake of ammonium (NH4+) of 0.02 t and 0.40 t of nitrite (NO2−), which are also crucial nutrients for bacterial proliferation.

The mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum is a relatively small (≤ 6 mm) dioecious snail that feeds on detritus by surface scraping. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on dead organic matter (detritus) often live in environments with limited and variable quantities and qualities of food, and consumer growth and reproduction is well known to be influenced by the chemical composition or quality of their food. Detritus has a low nutritional value, which is compensated by ingesting large amounts of material that passes rapidly through their gut and is only partly digested. Large quantities of detritus are thus required to sustain populations of detritivores. Indeed, populations of e.g. deposit-feeders are often food-limited and food enrichment has been shown to increase growth and fecundity. This suggests that, although various life history strategies have been observed for aquatic invertebrates, lakes with high(er) primary productivity and detritus inputs more likely stimulate growth and reproduction of aquatic invertebrates.

PMC3983233_P005,"In this study we investigated the potential mechanisms underpinning the spread of Caulerpa filiformis. We focused on its interactions with one of the dominant brown algal complexes in the mid to low intertidal, namely Sargassum spp. We tested two hypotheses relating to colonization of space created by a disturbance. First that Caulerpa filiformis would colonize space, via the recruitment of progagules, faster than Sargassum spp., regardless of whether that space was created within beds of Sargassum spp. (hereafter, Sargassum habitat) or within beds of Caulerpa filiformis (hereafter, Caulerpa habitat). Second, in patches created on boundaries between Sargassum habitat and Caulerpa habitat, Caulerpa filiformis would colonise the space via vegetative growth faster than Sargassum spp. Both of these mechanisms of colonisation can contribute to high demographic rates and the spread of opportunistic species. We also hypothesized that epibiotic assemblages in newly colonized patches in Caulerpa habitat would be less diverse than those within Sargassum habitat. These three hypotheses were tested by mimicking physical disturbance at multiple sites. We created patches of different sizes because patterns of colonization, and hence assemblage structure, can vary significantly with patch size. We predicted that patch size would influence the magnitude of differences between habitats. Finally, we hypothesized that Caulerpa filiformis would negatively affect the health of Sargassum spp. and tested this by comparing the photosynthetic ability of Sargassum spp. where it interacted with Caulerpa filiformis versus areas where it did not. We tested this latter hypothesis as invasive macrophytes can have sublethal effects on native species that cannot be detected by population level studies e.g..",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC3728934_P034,"Two historical features remain at odds with our findings: the Fulmarus fossil record and the Pacific coast origin hypothesis. Two prehistoric fossils from Kern County, California are attributed to the genus, including the proximal end of a carpometacarpus identified as Fulmarus hammeri and a complete humerus identified as Fulmarus miocaenus. These fossils were said to belong to the Barstovian and Clarendonian stages, respectively, which roughly range from 10 to 16 Mya. This timeline vastly predates our estimates for the time to most recent common ancestor for even Fulmarus-Macronectes, and instead is more in line with the origin of the entire Fulmarini clade. Given that we used well-accepted fossil calibrations to obtain our date estimates, we propose that the Howard fossils likely belonged to either an ancestral lineage or to independent lineages with no modern descendents, but in either case should not be included in the genus Fulmarus. Wetmore describes a fossilized fragment of a left humerus collected in Maryland that is so similar to the modern day species that it “cannot be distinguished from [Fulmarus] glacialis”, but while he speculated that this fossil dated back to the Miocene (on account of its dark coloration and degree of fossilization), he also stated that the stratum from which it was collected is more consistent with a Pleistocene origin.

This discrepancy could be due to the ecosystem complexity. In oligotrophic conditions, warming-stimulated bacterial growth could be constrained by resource limitation, whereas our study bay is highly eutrophic as a result of a typical aquaculture area for three decades.

Our findings are in accordance with previous studies wherein an increase in temperature with sufficient substrate supply enable bacterial abundance to temporarily exceed grazing losses.

PMC3976036_P002,"Here, we ask whether pleiotropy or linkage is responsible for the correlation between lateral plate presence and another trait: the distribution of the neuromasts of the lateral line. The lateral line sensory system in aquatic vertebrates detects water motion and has been shown to play a role in schooling, predator avoidance, prey capture, and other behaviors. The lateral line system comprises clusters of sensory hair cells called neuromasts, which are arranged in distinct lines on the body and head. Threespine sticklebacks possess twelve lines of superficial neuromasts: nine on the head, two on the trunk, and one at the base of the caudal fin. The number of neuromasts in each line varies in sticklebacks from different habitats in parallel with the environment, suggesting that the differences among populations might be adaptive. Lateral line variation across stickleback populations is particularly striking in the lines along the trunk, both in the number of neuromasts and in the distribution of those neuromasts. Specifically, variation in neuromast distribution is correlated with the presence of bony lateral plates (Figure 
1), a trait that varies consistently and predictably in marine versus freshwater environments. Neuromasts on the trunk of sticklebacks can be separated into two anatomical regions: those located in body segments anterior to the second dorsal spine are considered ‘Ma’ (main trunk line, anterior) and those located in body segments posterior to this boundary are called ‘Mp’ (main trunk line, posterior; Figure 
2D). Marine sticklebacks, like those from the Pacific Ocean in Japan (‘JP’) or Manchester Clam Bay in Washington State, USA (‘MC’), have a complete set of bony plates along their entire flank, in body segments coincident with both Ma and Mp (Figure 
1). They typically have a vertical line of neuromasts, with pairs of neuromasts (one dorsal and one ventral to the midline; hereafter called a ‘dorso-ventral’ distribution) on each of the plates coincident with Mp and clusters of multiple vertically arranged neuromasts on each of the plates coincident with Ma. Most freshwater populations also have bony plates in the region of the Ma line, and these plates possess a dorso-ventral distribution of neuromasts. However, most freshwater sticklebacks are low plated; that is, they have no bony plates in the region of the Mp line, and each body segment in this region has a single neuromast that is located along the midline. Several freshwater populations, including benthic sticklebacks from Paxton Lake in British Columbia, Canada (‘PB’), exhibit striking reduction in plate number, with very few plates in the region of the Ma line in addition to a complete lack of plates in the region of the Mp line. The neuromasts in both the Ma and Mp lines are found in a nearly continuous row along the midline (Figure 
1), although there are a few neuromasts dorsal to the midline in the Ma line even in the absence of plates (Figure 
3A). These fish also exhibit extra trunk neuromasts, with up to five neuromasts per body segment.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC8432827_P032,"Two species included in the study have diets that are not well-documented in wild individuals. Using the calculated ranges of dental complexities and observations of tooth morphology, we are able to propose possible dietary categories for Hydrosaurus amboinensis and Lanthanotus borneensis. The specimen of Hydrosaurus amboinensis has an avgOPCR of 7.874 PPT which exists within the complexity ranges of insectivores (5.431–9.865 PPT) and omnivores (8.990 PPT). The dental morphology of Hydrosaurus amboinensis consists of sharp, conical, recurved anterior teeth and labiolingually-compressed, triangular-shaped posterior teeth. Similar dental morphologies exist among both insectivores and omnivores, so it is plausible that Hydrosaurus amboinensis could belong to either category.

Hydrosaurus pustulatus is entirely folivorous, but phylogenetic studies reconstruct an omnivorous Agamidae ancestor. Given an ancestral omnivorous diet, it is possible that Hydrosaurus amboinensis could have retained omnivory instead of evolving herbivory like Hydrosaurus pustulatus.

The presence of such organisms and the shifts observed in these groups are indications that the effects of environmental conditions on mangrove functioning might exert selection pressure on the sulfate- and sulfite-reducing process. In addition, Desulfovibrionales has a more efficient nutrient uptake and reduced energy utilization in oligotrophic environment, partly explaining their distinct distribution patterns.

PMC3509092_P042,"We documented the complex link between disturbance and behavioural response in a human-dominated landscape, though we were not able to estimate the actual cost of human disturbance on wildlife in terms of fitness and population dynamics. Behavioural responses by elk to the risk of predation by wolves have been shown to be correlated with increased vigilance, reduced foraging and food intake. Parallel to these behavioral responses, physiological data have revealed a decrease in the quantity of food obtained by elk in the presence of wolves and changes in the composition of their diet that exacerbate nutritional deficits in winter. Ultimately, predation risk induced decreased fecal progesterone concentrations and decreased calf recruitment in elk. Thus, the actual cost of predation risk by natural predator has already been documented, at least for the wolf-elk predator prey system, but not for ecological contexts where humans are a major source of disturbance for wildlife.

PMC8270485_P001,"Urban greenspaces, such as parks and residential gardens, are critically important for promoting mental and physical well-being and for reducing morbidity and mortality. According to the United Nations, 68% of the global population will live in cities by 2050, increasing the environmental and social stresses for the billions of humans living in urban areas. Urban greenspaces make up most of the open spaces available for recreational activities in urban areas such as sport and social engagement and play important roles in curbing pollution, reducing noise, and lowering air temperatures. Urban greenspaces also provide habitat for a myriad of plants and animals including a wide range of bird species (e.g., pigeons), terrestrial and arboreal mammals (e.g., squirrels), and diverse above- and below-ground invertebrates. Similarly, soils in urban greenspaces are also home to a diverse community of microbes, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, and protists. This soil biodiversity plays important roles in maintaining ecosystem services such as soil fertility, plant health, productivity, and waste decomposition. Moreover, human exposure to soil microbes has been shown to be beneficial to human health by promoting effective immunoregulation functions and reducing allergies. However, some soil microbes (e.g., Mycobacterium, Listeria, and Fusarium spp.) can also have substantial negative consequences for the sustainability of urban greenspaces and for animal, human, and plant health. For instance, some soil microbial taxa harbor antibiotic resistance genes and could potentially influence the health of people and animals by reducing our ability to fight human diseases. Unfortunately, unlike with urban birds, plants, and mammals, we have a very limited understanding of the identity and function of the soil organisms inhabiting our urban parks and gardens. Previous microbial studies in urban greenspaces have focused on specific locations (e.g., New York’s Central Park), specific groups of soil organisms (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi), or specific microbial functions (e.g., denitrification). However, we currently lack a global perspective on the soil microbiome of urban greenspaces and how these soil microbiomes compare to those found in nearby natural ecosystems. A comprehensive evaluation must consider multiple cities with contrasting populations, vegetation, and climates and include a wide range of functional and taxonomic groups of soil organisms.

Natural dispersal of these species over short distances within either continental coastline is likely facilitated by brief bouts of swimming associated with incoming tides and by rafting of frozen sediments in North America where winter temperatures are more severe than in Europe. For Corophium volutator, only two pairs of adjacent populations were not distinct in phylogenetic networks or clustering analyses, suggesting gene flow between them. The first pair of populations are separated by ~40 km in the Gulf of Maine, and the second pair are separated by ~130 km in the inner Bay of Fundy, which has extremely high tidal velocities. The proximity of these populations suggests they are connected by natural dispersal. In Hediste diversicolor, individuals from two populations separated by ~690 km, in Wexford, Ireland (Bannow Bay; BAN) and Normandy, France (Seine estuary; LAV), form two distinct genetic groups with individuals from each population in both clusters (Figure 2). This suggests either reciprocal exchange between these sites or movement from two other unsampled populations to both of these sites.

PMC8525183_P012,"It is still uncertain which sensory modality (vision or chemoperception) carabid species rely upon most to guide their food location and selection responses. Despite this uncertainty however, the evidence strongly hints that chemoperception is likely the top candidate for roles related to food searching and food choice in carabid predators. It can be proposed therefore that food selection decisions in carabid beetles, be that seed or prey, are generally guided by chemical cues encoding information that is interpreted based on innate or learned “templates” or “images” in the brain. As such, chemical cues emitted from different types of weed seeds in arable fields are expected to mediate seed recognition and seed selection in carabid weed seed predators. However, given the limited number of sensory studies and the highly diverse feeding habits of carabid species in arable fields, it cannot be ruled out that vision may also play some role in seed selection decisions, leading to the formation of complex search images in some cases. This uncertainty stems from reports showing diurnal carabid species that actively hunt live mobile prey usually carry larger compound eyes and shorter antennae that house significantly fewer olfactory receptors compared to nocturnal species. Such sensory differences seem to suggest that visual cues are likely to play more vital roles in guiding food searching behaviors in diurnal carabids compared to nocturnal ones. The same studies showed that visually driven hunting behaviors in carabid predators broke down when prey items were immobilized. Therefore, it could be suggested that carabid visual receptors are more finely‐tuned toward detecting movement and are not expected to be of much help when carabid predators are searching for immobile and often cryptic food items like weed seeds.

In a pattern repeated by multiple species on coral reefs spanning three major ocean basins and the Red Sea, Thalassoma have attained abundances at least three and up to 15 times greater than all other labrid species occupying exposed shallow reef habitats. Extreme levels of wave‐driven water motion appear crucial to this ecological success, with Thalassoma dominance only occurring within the most wave‐swept habitats of one of the most diverse regions in our study, the Great Barrier Reef.

PMC5378397_P039,"We provide the first reliable estimate of Cape Verde petrel population size in Fogo in ca. 293 birds, based on capture-mark-recapture from mist-nets. However, some lines of evidence suggest this estimation includes not only breeders, but also immature birds from different ages. Four of the 12 chicks born since 2012 were recaptured at the mist-nets 2 or 3 years after being ringed, evidencing that we are capturing young immatures in the mist-net. Additionally, two mist-netted birds captured in 2007 were deployed with geolocators which were recovered in 2010, when these birds were recaptured again at mist-net. These birds did not show any signs of incubation bouts during those years, suggesting these birds did not breed during three years. These evidences indicate birds caught at mist-nets are mainly immature and non-breeders visiting the area for displaying and courting. Probably, once birds are about 5 years old and find a partner and start breeding, they display and visit the courting area to a lesser extent. The fact that we are capturing all these immature birds would explain the relatively low survival probability compared to mean adult survival estimates of Procellariform species, since immature birds have lower survival rates. Indeed, with this low adult survival probability, Cape Verde population within the Fogo Natural Park would tend to decrease until extinction. Based on the brood patch score of the mist-netted birds, 40% of birds captured were possible breeders, but of the 20 birds breeding in the known nests only one was recaptured in the mist-net. If most Cape Verde petrels breeding within the Fogo Natural Park are not being captured because they do not overfly the area where the mist-net are set, the survival and demographic parameters may be underestimate. Nevertheless, the number of possible breeders captured in mist-net is indicating that we are capturing breeders from other breeding areas still not found, suggesting that our population size estimation includes breeders from different breeding areas. Breeders from other colonies located far from the mist-net area may not be captured. However, based on a previous study, the largest colony of Cape Verde petrel is located in Chã das Caldeiras, so we believe our estimation although with some limitations previously explained would be representative of the population size of Cape Verde petrels in Fogo. Based on the nests known and on the estimation of 117 possible breeders captured in the mist-net, the number of breeding pairs within the Park would probably not overcome 100 pairs, which would agree with the 80 pairs previously estimated by. Nevertheless, the number of breeding pairs is difficult to estimate, as there can be other breeders that may not be captured in the mist-net. We suggest that future studies should deploy small GPS/GSM in breeders captured at the mist-net and perform intensive nocturnal calling survey to find new breeding areas to improve the estimation of breeding pairs.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

A divergence of the host can also lead to a divergence of the virus (codivergence) and thus to a (local) congruence of both phylogenies. A match of the virus phylogeny with host evolutionary events at known dates can be used to adjust the virus phylogeny or corresponding molecular clocks. The ability of viruses to switch their hosts can enable viruses to replicate and spread more efficiently. This process is commonly known as an epidemic and is observed in pathogenic viruses. Owing to the advantages conferred by the conquest of new host territory, several researchers presume host switching as an elementary component of virus evolution that might initiate viral speciation.

PMC3797478_P017,"Our study is one of few demonstrating how the probability of double brooding varies in a population of known-aged individuals and interestingly seems to increase linearly with age with no sign of senescence. Other bird studies demonstrate some degree of senescence with peak reproduction occurring in middle-aged birds (2–4 years) that decreases thereafter, but these studies focus on clutch size or numbers of young fledged per nest and not specifically on the number of broods produced. Double brooding rates that increase linearly with age indicate that it may be a skill that is acquired with age in prothonotary warblers, and once an individual has been successful in such endeavors, they are more likely to repeat it. Our study demonstrates that prior experience seems to play a significant role in whether or not a bird will double brood. Female prothonotary warblers that double brood fledged nearly twice the number of offspring as females who did not, indicating a true reproductive benefit to this behavior. That older females are significantly more likely to double brood suggests that younger individuals are constrained in their reproductive performance either physiologically or in lack of skills. However, nearly 8% of first year breeding prothonotary warblers double brooded throughout the 17 years of our study suggesting that this option is indeed possible for young and inexperienced birds, possibly only in “good” years when there are abundant resources and decreased competition. It is possible that younger females withhold reproductive effort, especially in poor conditions, in an attempt to increase longevity and lifetime reproductive success.

The expression levels of mCherry were high in cells with evenly diffused LEF-10-EGFP, but the fluorescence of mCherry was undetectable in the cells containing LEF-10-EGFP aggregates25 (Fig. 1b). Further computational analysis showed that once such aggregation occurred, most of the LEF-10 protein concentrated in small areas in the infected cells (Fig. 1c). In our designed genetic sensor system, correlation of the LEF-10-EGFP state with its regulated mCherry readout implied that aggregation of LEF-10 limited the availability of the fusion protein to activate the AcMNPV late promoter thereby reducing the expression of the mCherry reporter. We speculate that aggregated nuclei of LEF-10-EGFP could be inducing soluble LEF-10-EGFP to adopt the aggregated form, resulting in depletion of soluble, functional LEF-10-EGFP and the subsequent repression of late gene expression. The aggregation propensity of LEF-10-EGFP in infected cells is consistent with the behavior described for previously identified prions28,29.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC4293887_P007,"Praziquantel (PZQ), a pyrazino-isoquinoline derivative is practically insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in ethanol, but very soluble in chloroform and dimethylsulfoxide. It is the drug of choice for treatment of all five species of human schistosomes, leading to cure rates of 60–90% in different epidemiological settings. Adult schistosomes exposed in vitro to 1–3 μM PZQ undergo almost immediate spastic paralysis. In parallel, vacuolization of parts of the tegument and surface blebbing occur, especially in male worms (Table 1). All worms die thereafter. These reproducible findings indicate that adult schistosomes bind PZQ, and that PZQ per se is schistosomicidal. In vivo, plasma concentrations of 1–10 μM are readily reached after a standard curative dose. In vivo, PZQ-induced muscle contraction and tegumental lesions produce a loss of attachment to the endothelial veins and dislodgment to the liver.

PMC3897644_P001,"The global demand for forests and forest products is increasing because of population growth. To meet this demand, the importance of plantations has increased because they have high wood-production rates compared with natural forests. Plantation forest production meets two-thirds of the global industrial roundwood demand. Therefore, plantation forests are reducing the pressure on natural forests for wood and other resources, but they simultaneously pose a threat by replacing natural forests. The objective of plantation forests is to produce timber and other wood products and to generate greater financial returns because of faster growth than occurs in natural forest regeneration. Plantations can also be used for land rehabilitation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and water conservation and they can provide socio-economic benefits, minimising the poverty of local people in developing countries. Different types of plantations are established for different purposes, and most are planted as monocultures. These monoculture plantations, such as rubber, teak, eucalyptus, cashew, oilpalm, acacia etc., have an adverse impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services. A recent report by Forest Resource Assessment showed that plantation forests account for 7% (264 million ha) of total global forest area. During the period from 2005 to 2010, the area of planted forests increased by about 5 million ha per year worldwide. In Asia, plantation area has increased rapidly in recent years. Plantations have become an interesting topic of research under the current scenario of climate change. Carbon (C) sequestration by plantation species has become an essential concern because consideration of its effects and calculation of C-credits during climate change negotiations require estimates of C sequestration by plantation species. Therefore, examinations of plantation biophysical parameters are necessary to precisely calculate biomass. To improve sustainability, a certain ratio between plantation and natural forests is necessary. Cashew and rubber plants are the major plantation species in Cambodia. Both species are exotics, and the two types of plantations differ in their canopy cover, tree size, orientation of branches, and tree distribution.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

The residues important for interactions with ParB are located at the external part of the loop, consistent with the idea that this part of the protein may be involved in partner binding.

Phylum-level relative abundances plots revealed that rhizosphere bacterial communities shifted from the initial period (D0) to stages D1 to D3. The result showed that the effect of plant growth on bacterial communities was more obvious at the sorghum vegetative growth stage, and bacterial abundances relative stability after flowering (from D2 to D3) (Fig. 3B) Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were dramatically higher in the jointing stage than in the other two stages. However, the different varieties showed different interactions with the bacteria. For the sensitive variety HN16, the influence of growth on bacterial diversity was less than that of the tolerant variety GLZ (Fig. 3B). Constrained analysis of communities against development time using distance-based redundancy analysis (RDA) also revealed a clear gradual community shift across the different development time points for rhizosphere bacteria, and the shifts correlated with the changes in the soil salt content and sorghum variety (Fig. 3C), indicating complex interactions among the soil salt content, growth stage, and plant genotype.

PMC8245590_P014,"To successfully capture resources in an unfavourable environment, plants often invest more in the biomass of some components than under normal conditions53,54. For example, to obtain O2, CO2 and light resources, the proportion of underground biomass of the erect submersible plants Potamogeton maackianus and Potamogeton malaianus decreased with increasing water level, and thus, the proportion of stem biomass increased55. The biomass allocation strategy of Alternanthera philoxeroides was similar under varying water conditions; with the increase of the water level, the stem mass ratio increased, while the leaf mass ratio and root mass ratio decreased. This was related to the elongation of the stem under the condition of more water, the leaf shedding under submergence, and the need to develop roots to absorb water under water deficit conditions. This was the manifestation of the strategy adopted by the Alternanthera philoxeroides to adapt to changes in the water conditions and improve the survival ability. The leaf mass ratio in the treatment without leaves was higher than that in the treatment with leaves, and it was especially significant in Exp. 2.

PMC5684829_P002,"Balantidium ctenopharyngodoni Chen, 1955 is a native species of China and a common obligatory intestinal parasite of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). It was first discovered and simply documented by Chen, then, its morphology redescribed, pathogenicity, ultrastructural anatomy and related molecular phylogeny were studied, respectively. As for phylogenetic analysis, the related studies reconstructed the phylogenetic trees only based on the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) gene. The SSU rDNA gene is the most common gene marker for phylogenetic analysis, which was first used by Lynn et al. to demonstrate divergences among ciliates over 25 years ago. For example, it was applied to place the hymenostomes and peritrichs as sister lineages. However, with the development of high-throughput sequencing in recent decades, enormous amounts of omics data have become available for phylogenetic analysis, potentially including hundreds of thousands of loci, which provide much more information compared to single or multi-gene analysis. To take full advantage of this abundant data, phylogenomics −research into evolutionary relationships based on comparative analysis of omics data − was proposed to replace single-gene phylogenetics, through the use of genomics rather than single-gene information. This makes it possible to avoid problems related to sufficient sample size by addition of more sites from multiple genes or to compensate for biased base compositions. Although some of these problems will also affect phylogenies reconstructed from large datasets, others will be substantially reduced and/or easily diagnosed. To date, several ciliates have been sequenced and analyzed, such as Tetrahymena thermophila, Paramecium tetraurelia, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Pseudocohnilembus persalinus and Oxytricha trifallax, and the results obtained were used for phylogenomic analysis.

PMC6051568_P003,"Subsequent to the discovery of such “self-reporting signatures” in echolocation pulses, experimental studies tested the ability of bats to perceive these signatures. Much of the work on species discrimination has been done on horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae). Horseshoe bats are ambush hunters and echolocate readily while at rest, scanning their environment for insect prey. They belong to the group of high duty-cycle (HDC) echolocating bats–the pulses of which are characterised by long, narrowband echolocation pulses, separated by relatively short inter-pulse intervals. Rhinolophid HDC pulses are dominated by a long constant frequency (CF) component, flanked by two short frequency modulated (FM) components (Fig 1). The frequency of the CF component of these pulses emitted while at rest, referred to as the ‘resting frequency’ (RF; Fig 1), is a few hundred Hertz below that of the acoustic fovea of each bat. The acoustic fovea is a disproportionately high representation of neurons in the auditory system associated with a narrow range of frequencies known as the reference frequency. In combination with Doppler shift compensation, the acoustic fovea allows the detection of fluttering insects in dense vegetation. While in flight the frequency of the echoes of the bat’s echolocation pulse will be shifted up as a result of the motion of the bat relative to a target. To compensate for this shift in the frequency of the echo, known as the Doppler effect (hence Doppler shift compensation, DSC), the bat emits echolocation pulses with a CF frequency at a slightly lower frequency than the reference frequency so that the frequency of the returning echo falls within the narrow frequency range of the acoustic fovea. Given the importance of the CF component to the echolocation system of these bats and early reports that different sympatric species appear to use different CFs, it was assumed that frequency of the CF component was the crucial carrier of species-specific cues.",horseshoe bats,insects,hunt,predation,Rhinolophidae,Insecta,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC6145031_P029,"The detection of significant environmental effects on the motile guild supported the importance of niche‐based processes in affecting loosely attached diatoms (“strong dispersers”). This is particularly evident in the Bolivian‐Brazilian lowlands, where the strength of the environmental component outperformed the effect of spatial factors on diatom community composition, likely due to the high environmental heterogeneity of tropical floodplain lakes, which is evident in the Pantanal lakes. These hydrologically pulsing environments favor the dispersal of aquatic microorganisms among habitats. Although local environmental variables appeared to exert a major control on planktic communities (Supporting Information Appendix S5—Figure S5.3), variance partitioning did not provide support for niche‐based assembly processes for the planktic guild among‐lake clusters, in which pure spatial controls were mostly detected. Dispersal‐related mechanisms in diatom metacommunities have also been suggested in mountainous areas where constrained aerial dispersed is likely due to high elevational gradients and step valleys. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the nonsignificant environmental structure at metacommunity level is a product of the low abundance of planktic taxa in our database (10% of the total taxa), or the noninclusion of ecologically important processes for phytoplankton communities (e.g., biotic interactions, trophic state).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC4958003_P002,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become an effective means of conserving reef ecosystems from human impacts, while still allowing for recreational use of resources including scuba diving and snorkelling. Considered by some to be the ‘pinnacle’ in marine conservation, an MPA is defined as “an area of sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means”. The last four decades have witnessed a proliferation of MPAs globally. Burke et al. note that over two and a half thousand marine parks and equivalent protected areas have been designated to conserve coral reef habitats, amounting to 6% of the worlds coral reefs being managed. The many conservation benefits of MPAs are well documented, including an increase in the size and biomass of fish species. As a consequence, biological enhancement typically increases the attractiveness of marine parks to divers and snorkellers, though this in itself may cause a dilemma between protection and use of coral reef resources.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

This may be caused by cumulative effects of continuous exposure to Coxiella burnetii with time or may be linked to increasing immune competence with the individual’s age. Two observations point to an effect of host immune competence as the causal factor for this age-related increase in seroprevalence and antibody levels: (i) the increasing trend in both parameters up to the fourth year of life (similar to findings in cattle, 27) and the decreasing pattern thereafter; and (ii) the low average half-life of anti-Coxiella burnetii antibodies observed (discussed below).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC5784127_P013,"Higher increases in viral decay rates were always observed for low-fluorescence viruses in our experiments (Figs 3 and 5). When the +4 °C condition was compared with the in situ temperature, the viral decay rates increased by 75.46 ± 22.55% (n = 6, ±SE) and 120.44 ± 31.62% (n = 6, ±SE) for high- and low-fluorescence viruses, respectively. The high- and low-fluorescence virus decay rates increased 1.02 ± 0.23-fold (n = 6, ±SE) and 2.35 ± 0.76-fold (n = 6, ±SE), respectively, under the highest PAR compared with those in the dark. These suggested that high-fluorescence viruses might be more resistant to warming and PAR damage than low-fluorescence viruses. These results might be partially explained by the different density of packaged nucleic acid material (ρpack) for high- and low-fluorescence viruses, where ρpack is expressed as the volume occupied by the genome divided by the internal volume of the capsid. Relatively large capsid volume of algal viruses, which usually appear as high-fluorescence populations in flow cytometry34,43, usually results in a relatively low ρpack. For instance, the ρpack of algal viruses varies from ~0.15 to 0.444–49, which are smaller than those of low-fluorescence viruses such as bacteriophages19. A higher ρpack suggests a higher internal pressure of viral particles, which may release packaged nucleic acid material when the capsid is ruptured by stressful conditions19. Therefore, the low-fluorescence virus with higher ρpack appears more sensitive to warming and increased PAR than high-fluorescence virus in this study.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC2841750_P011,"We took 87 measurements of oxygen consumption of different roosting groups almost each day over 109 days between 15 May 2006 and 31 August 2006. The energy expenditure for each roosting group in each bat box was calculated as daily resting energy expenditure (DREE). This is a minimum estimate of energy expenditure because it does not include additional costs of foraging. We calculated DREE in millilitres O2 per hour from the average MR from 1200 to 1900 hours. This time frame was chosen because comparable data sets were available for this period and this is one of the most consistent resting phases of Bechstein’s bats (this study) as well as of other vespertilionid bat species. This time frame nevertheless also comprised phases when the bats were active, engaging in grooming and social interactions. To present results for energy expenditure (kilojoules per day) of each roosting group, we transferred DREE into units of power. At the RQ of 0.85, the caloric equivalent of oxygen consumption is 20.37 kJ/l O2. During the post-lactation period, we did not calculate DREE because bats entered torpor every day when we measured oxygen consumption. To compare energy expenditure between different group sizes, we calculated MR per animal in a roosting group.

In addition, low haematocrits can also be caused by hematofagous ectoparasites, which is consistent with the higher flea prevalence observed in tourist-visited chicks.

At each site, ten artificial nests, each consisting of two Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) eggs, were set out in a line, imitating the nests of hazel grouse, a ground-nesting bird species common in the study area. Hazel grouse nests were simulated by scraping vegetation and litter from the soil surface and making a small depression in the ground where two eggs were placed (Fig. 2). The nests were placed at the base of standing large trees or large fallen logs or trees, and at about 50% of tree canopy cover. Eggs were kept refrigerated until the day they were deployed in the field. We used latex gloves and rubber boots during handling to reduce human scent. In any case, the amount of scent tracks that we could leave would be similar in both feeding and control sites. Nests at a given site were placed about 25–30 m away from each other by step counting. GPS coordinates were taken at each nest and the distance to the middle point of the feeding site measured. A spruce branch was placed at the tree or log near each nest to facilitate relocation. To control for potential effects of the features of the nest location, each nest was assigned to one of the two location categories: tree base or fallen log/tree.

PMC4051378_P008,"Every microbe has an optimum pH range. Most microorganisms are suited by a neutral environment while some are acidophilic or basophilic. The effect of initial pH on the fungus Ganoderma lucidum, which can produce simultaneously ganoderic acid and a polysaccharide, has been studied. And the authors find that the maximum biomass and production of ganoderic acid is obtained at an initial pH of 6.5. However, the production of extracellular and intracellular polysaccharides becomes higher when the initial pH drops to 3.5. RPS lived better under a meta-acid environment (Figure 2 (i)). A low initial pH of 5 significantly increased the biomass and algicidal activity by 22.5% and 43.8%, respectively. This large improvement with low initial pH suggested that more thorough studies should be conducted.Inoculum size strongly affected the growth rate of the strain. High inoculum size could bring forward the stationary phase and the synthesis of metabolites, therefore also decrease the possibility of contamination. However, too high an inoculum size might also reduce the yield of products owing to the high consumption of oxygen. In Figure 2 (ii), the biomass had a positive correlation with inoculum size while the algicidal activity stayed at a high level even with the lowest inoculum size of 1%. Interestingly, the 10% inoculum size raised the biomass by 28.7%, but the algicidal activity decreased by 26.6% under the same inoculum size. This could be explained by the early coming of the late stationary phase blocking the synthesis of algicidal compounds. Thus, further optimization seemed to be necessary.In most cases, the loaded volume affected the fermentation process owing to its association with dissolved oxygen. Lower loaded volume led to a higher oxygen transfer coefficient under the same shaking speed. In Figure 2 (iii), the biomass and algicidal activity is raised along with the volume up to 75 mL, and no huge gap is seen between 75, 100 and 125 mL. This result indicated that the high oxygen level might be a restricting factor to the growth of RPS.RPS was isolated from the sediment sample of an estuarine area, which explained why its biomass could reach a peak value at a salinity of 20 (124.8% compared to the control group in Figure 2 (iv)). However, the algicidal activity showed a different pattern. Only salinity levels of 0 and 10 induced the production of algicidal compounds, compared to the most fit salinity of 20 for mycelia growth. A good fermentation result under 0 salinity was beneficial for future large-scale production since high salinity has a strong corrosion effect on steel fermentation tanks.Fermentation time can characterize the growth rate of a strain, and RPS was a relatively slow-growing microbe (Figure 2 (v)). The biomass continued to increase even after 8d, but the algicidal compounds were secreted only after 6d, which might mark the beginning of the stationary phase. The slight decrease of the algicidal ratio at 10d also confirmed the situation in the case of high inoculum size, suggesting the importance of harvesting the fermentation broth at an appropriate growth phase in order to maximize the yield of algicidal compounds.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC3894904_P005,"To address the first question, we need to establish if a decrease in size under a warmer climate improves fitness. The main adaptive mechanism for Bergmann's rule is a decrease in the surface area to volume ratio, reducing heat loss in colder conditions. However, the selection pressure and underlying mechanisms driving Bergmann's rule vary across different groups of animals. Bergmann's rule can thus be considered both sensu stricto and sensu lato. In both, a decrease in size is related to an increase in temperature. With a narrow definition of Bergmann's rule, body size decrease is mechanistically linked to energy and heat dissipation, and is adaptive. In a broader sense, the decrease in size may be driven by other factors (e.g. food availability, length of the growth season) than temperature. With that latter definition, size declines may still be adaptive, but not necessarily. Assessing the adaptive nature of size changes thus does not validate Bergmann's rule either way, but is important for assessing the mechanisms that can enhance population persistence in the context of global change. Inferring the direction of selection is also necessary to evaluate the adaptive nature of size changes, whether selection pressures are due to climatic or other environmental variables.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

Our research highlights the need for a multi-level and cross-disciplinary approach to the management of this issue. Top-down approaches are in force that make use of mosquito nets for fishing illegal in some localities, however, such mechanisms are evidently insufficient and need re-thinking. We believe that bottom-up approaches may be more beneficial to understanding the drivers that result in the use of mosquito nets in fishing, and for communities to help develop solutions to these challenges. Generally, greater effort is needed to ensure that mosquito nets are being used for the purpose intended.

With reference to our results, the significant association between the environmental factors and morphometrics, together with the decreasing E/BS along elevation, our Hypothesis 1 that ecogeographical adaptation may occur in an interactive change between body size and extremities is supported. The significant effects of sex and age and the results from hierarchical partitioning relate to Hypothesis 2, i.e., geographic variation in anurans’ morphology is an outcome of combined environmental and biological effects. Although age and sex were the only biological factors included in our study, we discussed several reproduction-related explanations for the sexual differences in the morphological variation of Rana kukunoris. However, the explanatory power of the biological factors and our statistical models could be improved by adding or substituting with other biological variables that are also proven to remarkably affect anurans’ morphological growth, such as the length of the juvenile period or first-year growth and age at sexual maturity. The validity of our explanation may require future studies to include a reproduction-related factor for further examination. In conclusion, our results emphasize that geographic variation in anurans’ morphology should be viewed as a consequence or trade-off between the environmental effect and biological issues. The ratio between extremities and body size could be taken into account for the future study of ecogeographical patterns in anurans.

Fig 1a represents a decision hierarchy that human foragers face in their use of space, and Fig 1b illustrates the scale of the hierarchy relevant to the emergence of habitat partitioning and territorial ownership. In general, at the habitat scale, some set of potential habitats exists on a landscape in which foragers may reside. Each forager must decide how many of that potential set of habitats to use, how much time to spend in any given habitat exploiting its patches and which habitats to move between. Our basic idea is that partitioning and ownership interrelate due to the feedback between these decision processes in a variable environment. To study the feedback between these decision processes, we construct a dynamic ecological model called the spatial foraging effort model (or the SPDm for short). The SPDm is a two habitat model. This allows us to hold the question of which habitats to move between constant and focus on the feedback between the number of potential habitats (one vs. two), and how much time to spend in a given habitat exploiting its resource patches.

PMC3219973_P009,"At present, however, we suspect that hybridization between CMs and WMs may be a more parsimonious explanation for our observations. Under one conception, haplogroup C could have been a predominantly CM haplogroup that introgressed into WM populations, at such a frequency that it came to dominate the North American mitochondrial gene pool of that species. The fact that both CMs sequenced here are haplogroup C would lend some support to this hypothesis. Another possibility is that introgression occurred in the opposite direction, such that WM-typical haplogroup C introgressed into CM populations (Figure 2a). From a behavioral perspective, this configuration is perhaps more likely, especially in light of phenomena documented in extant African forest (Loxodonta cyclotis) and savanna (Loxodonta africana) elephants (Figure 2b). These living species are morphologically distinct and deeply divergent at many nuclear loci, but are known to interbreed at forest-savanna ecotones. The result is 'cytonuclear dissociation' between genomes in hybrid individuals, such that forest-typical mitochondrial haplotypes occur at low frequency in savanna populations. Hypothetically, this is driven by savanna males reproductively out-competing physically smaller forest males, producing unidirectional backcrossing of hybrid females into savanna populations. Since mammoths were probably very similar to modern elephants in social and reproductive behavior, it is conceivable that WMs and the physically larger CMs engaged in a similar dynamic when they encountered each other. Indeed, hybridization between CMs and WMs has already been suggested by others, and genetic exchange may explain mammoths bearing CM-WM intermediate morphologies. Such mammoths are frequently found in areas where CMs and WMs overlapped in time and space, such as the Great Lakes region. Some of these apparent intermediates have been formally named (for example, Mammuthus jeffersonii), but their taxonomic identity is questionable. Indeed, the large number of synonyms currently registered for North American mammoths is at least partly a function of efforts by earlier systematists to come to grips with the large amount of morphological variation expressed within Mammuthus (or Elephas). Although the Huntington mammoth exhibits no such morphological intermediacy and was found quite distant from the documented WM range, its status as a genetic hybrid would not be inconsistent with the modern analog: forest haplotype-bearing savanna elephants can be found several thousands of kilometers from modern ecotones, bearing no phenotypic indication of hybridism.",loxodonta africana,loxodonta cyclotis,out-compete,competition,Loxodonta africana,Loxodonta cyclotis,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC3219973_P009,"At present, however, we suspect that hybridization between CMs and WMs may be a more parsimonious explanation for our observations. Under one conception, haplogroup C could have been a predominantly CM haplogroup that introgressed into WM populations, at such a frequency that it came to dominate the North American mitochondrial gene pool of that species. The fact that both CMs sequenced here are haplogroup C would lend some support to this hypothesis. Another possibility is that introgression occurred in the opposite direction, such that WM-typical haplogroup C introgressed into CM populations (Figure 2a). From a behavioral perspective, this configuration is perhaps more likely, especially in light of phenomena documented in extant African forest (Loxodonta cyclotis) and savanna (Loxodonta africana) elephants (Figure 2b). These living species are morphologically distinct and deeply divergent at many nuclear loci, but are known to interbreed at forest-savanna ecotones. The result is 'cytonuclear dissociation' between genomes in hybrid individuals, such that forest-typical mitochondrial haplotypes occur at low frequency in savanna populations. Hypothetically, this is driven by savanna males reproductively out-competing physically smaller forest males, producing unidirectional backcrossing of hybrid females into savanna populations. Since mammoths were probably very similar to modern elephants in social and reproductive behavior, it is conceivable that WMs and the physically larger CMs engaged in a similar dynamic when they encountered each other. Indeed, hybridization between CMs and WMs has already been suggested by others, and genetic exchange may explain mammoths bearing CM-WM intermediate morphologies. Such mammoths are frequently found in areas where CMs and WMs overlapped in time and space, such as the Great Lakes region.

PMC7696197_P005,"Among bacterial species inhabiting a genitourinary niche, one could mention Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Prevotella, Sneathia, Atopobium, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae in women, and Lactobacillus, Sneathia, Veillonella, Corynebacterium, Prevotella, Streptococcus and Ureaplasma in men. Bladder microbiome has a low biomass relative to the vaginal microbiome and is dominated by Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and Streptococcus. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) can invade and replicate within the bladder cells to form intracellular complexes, making them resistant to antibacterials and the host immune system. The composition of the urobiome, similar to that of the intestinal model, changes in an age- and health-dependent manner. While Lactobacillus crispatus, along with Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Corynebacterium were found only in healthy individuals, the Streptococcus genus was found more frequently in patients with bladder cancer. Such health-dependent alterations in urinary microbiota are also described in diabetes patients by Liu et al.. The authors observed significantly lower association between the presence of Lactobacillus in the group of patients with diabetes and hypertension, and higher in the diabetes only, and diabetes with hyperlipidemia cohorts. Recent studies imply that composition of urinary microbiome may be responsible, at least partially, with age, body mass index, and concomitant therapies, for urinary incontinence in women. The prevalence of Lactobacillus gasseri in the bladder was shown in women with urge incontinence, while Lactobacillus crispatus was typical for those without symptoms.. It was shown that human microbiome is inherently dynamic and varies across populations with various health conditions. It is no different with urobiome. Price et al. found that urobiome composition changes during menstruation and vaginal intercourse, but is relatively stable during health. Similar observations have been noted by Ghose et al. who found that viromes of urine, saliva, and feces were of relatively high diversity, in contrast to breast milk, body fluids, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

While the partitioning of shallow and deeper water vertebrate communities broadly conformed to known habitat preferences, taphonomic processes may also reduce the detection of surface-dwelling taxa. Solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet (UV) light, is highest in surface waters and may increase DNA denaturation and degradation. Similarly, surface water temperatures are warmer, potentially increasing microbial and enzymatic activity, accelerating eDNA degradation. Conversely, settlement processes could also elevate eDNA community diversity at depth. Common sources of eDNA (e.g. feces) are often too large to remain suspended, potentially inflating eDNA community diversity at depth as these particles sink. In our study, some pelagic, surface-dwelling species were found in the deep stations, possibly due to such settlement processes. For example, Topsmelt silverside Atherinops affinis, California grunion Leuresthes tenuis and Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax were pelagic species found in the 9 m and 10 m stations. Though these three species were found in the deeper stations, they had low abundances in these stations and had much higher abundances in the shallow stations (Fig 3).

These capital breeders rely entirely on stored energy (blubber) to fuel long migrations in order to breed, without the option of replenishment. Budgeting energy use will therefore form a crucial component to ensure migration is completed successfully and reproductive investment maximized. In this study, we developed a theoretical bioenergetics model for migrating humpback whales to investigate the optimal migration ­strategy that minimizes individual energy use. We focus on the first 3 months of the southbound leg of the journey, between departure from breeding areas on the northwest Australian coast and arrival at the foraging grounds in the Southern Ocean. The two main factors contributing to energy conservation were the average migration velocity and the amount of time spent resting vs. travelling. Velocity, in particular, had a large influence on total transport costs. Disturbance to migration energetics changed the allocation of energy in whales; an increase in both average velocity (thereby increasing drag) and migration distance resulted in increased total energy use, impacting the growth rates of calves.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC6188897_P008,"We obtained whole-genome sequences for 22 independent spontaneous resistant mutants of PAO1 selected against 10 focal phages to identify mutational changes associated with specific phage resistance profiles (Fig 3; S5 Fig). Cross-resistance within module 2 was associated with mutations in LPS biosynthesis genes wzy and wbpL, whereas cross-resistance within module 1 was associated with mutations in various genes encoding type IV pilus biosynthesis (Fig 3; S1 Table). These included genes encoding mechanical components of the type IV pilus, such as the motor proteins PilB and PilT, and enzymes involved in type IV pilus biosynthesis and assembly such as PilD, a prepilin peptidase. These data confirm that cross-resistance modules were determined by distinct phage adsorption cell-surface receptors—specifically, the LPS for module 2 phages and the type IV pilus for module 1 phages. We confirmed distinct receptor usage by testing the ability of all 27 phages to infect an unpiliated pilB transposon mutant: whereas module 1 phages were unable to form plaques on the unpiliated host, module 2 phages infected the unpiliated mutant at the same efficiency as they infected the piliated wild-type PAO1 host (all p > 0.1; S6 Fig; S4 Data). Between-module cross-resistance was associated with mutations in genes encoding the transcriptional regulators RpoN and PilS (Fig 3; S1 Table). This suggests that more generalist phage resistance required changes in bacterial gene regulation, which are likely to have broader-scale effects on the bacterial phenotype than mutations affecting structural genes performing steps in biosynthetic pathways.

Here we report the asymmetric structure of such a virus, bacteriophage MS2, bound to its receptor the E. coli F-pilus. MS2 has a T = 3 morphology, an architecture that requires the single CP to adopt three quasi-equivalent conformations. The building block of the MS2 capsid is a CP dimer, and two distinct types of this dimer are found in the capsid; an asymmetric (A/B) dimer, and a symmetric (C/C) dimer (Figure 1A). The A/B dimers extend from the 5-fold axes to the 3-fold axes, while the C/C-type dimers sit on the 2-fold axes. MS2 encapsidates an ∼3.6 kb, +ssRNA genome that encodes four gene products: maturation protein (MP), CP, and lysis and replicase proteins (Figure 1B). The genomic RNA is not resolved in the crystal structure, a result that was thought to arise from a lack of order in its packing. More recently, however, cryo-EM reconstruction using icosahedral symmetry averaging has shown that the genome is extensively ordered at intermediate resolution, a discrepancy explained by the fact that, in early X-ray diffraction studies, the low-resolution data needed to resolve imperfectly ordered material were rarely recorded. Cryo-EM shows the genomic RNA as two concentric shells of density. The first (at higher radius) is intimately associated with the inner surface of the CP shell, which presents a lattice of RNA binding sites. This is important because RNA binding promotes an allosteric shift in conformation from a symmetric, C/C-like dimer to an asymmetric A/B-like conformation; i.e., the genome specifies the quasi-equivalent conformation of its own CP. The second shell (at lower radius) corresponds to RNA not bound to the CP layer and appears to be ordered by steric and/or electrostatic interactions, including contacts to the MP.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

The diversity of soil microorganisms (e.g., species richness and relative contribution of each species to the community composition), is vast, with a high level of functional redundancy in C and N transformations, which makes it difficult to explicitly integrate the microbial diversity in soil C and N models. Although including only two or three (if mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi are distinguished) functional groups of microbes substantially underrepresents their observed functional diversity in soils, the use of multiple SOM decomposing microbial functional groups has not been explored to date.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC8067026_P020,"Whilst the trace metal content of mussels will vary considerably by location and season, cultivated mussels are typically grown in areas of low pollution and in Australia, commercially cultured mussels are sampled and analysed prior to going to market. The Australia and New Zealand Food Standards (FSANZ) Code limits cadmium and lead levels in mollusks to 2 mg/kg wet weight. Therefore, based on the approach of Jovic et al. it is likely safe to eat 200 g of Australian mussels per week without exceeding the PTWI for cadmium. However, this is based on the FSANZ upper limit of 2 mg/kg of wet weight of mussels and the cadmium levels are likely much lower from commercial mussels harvested in Australia. This assumption is based on data from mussels that are often used as sentinel organisms to monitor the water for trace metal contamination. In one such study the authors transplanted mussels from a commercial mussel cultivator in South Australia. They sampled the transplanted mussels prior to deployment to establish a baseline trace metal contamination. The baseline cadmium concentration was reported to be ~1.25 µg/g dry weight, which calculated on the dry weight to wet weight conversions used in Shen et al., is equivalent to 0.53 mg/kg wet weight. Therefore, guided by data on cadmium intakes from these commercial mussels it would be safe to consume close to 800 g of these mussels per week. Whilst the conclusions of Jovic et al. apply to mussels landed from the Adriatic Sea, it is likely that similar conclusions can be drawn for commercially cultivated mussels in Australia.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA

PMC3480374_P023,"The FAs derived from enriched 13C ranged from tetradecanoic/myristic acid (C14∶0 ) to a long-chain FA, octacosaoctaenoic acid (OOA) (C28∶8). Specifically, the isotopic incorporation into myristic acid (C14∶0 ) within symbiotic anemones increased significantly from 24 hr (f = 18.33, P<0.01) until a Vmax 34.05% ± Std Dev 8.2 at 48 hr. After 48 hr, the incorporation and synthesis rate was consistent over time (Figure 2A). At 120 hr, the 13C incorporation in C14∶0 from the cumulative combined expelled dinoflagellate pellets (CEDPs) was 29.58% and similar to symbiotic anemones (34.3% ± Std Dev 3.33)(Figure 2A). The similar isotopic incorporation in FAs measured from the CEDP and symbiotic anemones continued across other FAs. The isotopic incorporation and synthesis rates of palmitic acid (C16∶0) and palmiteolic acid (C16∶1) were more linear over the total incubation period compared to C14∶0 (Figure 2B and 2C). There was a significant increase from 24 hr - 48 hr for C16∶0 (f = 59.06, P<0.01) and (C16∶1) (f = 49.68, P<0.01). Incorporation steadily increased over time, although the amount at 72 hr was not significantly different to that of 48 hr for both FAs. There was a further significant increase (P<0.05) between 72 hr and 120 hr for both FAs (23.73% ± Std Dev 1.92 for C16∶0; Figure 2B and 26.22% ± Std Dev 2.84 for C16∶1; Figure 2C).

PMC4219697_P032,"Starch accumulation is a common response to N limitation, both in plants and green algae, as well as in Lingulodinium polyedrum. However, it is unlikely that these different organisms share a common regulatory pathway, because they synthesize starch in different cellular compartments. In the plastids of plants and green algae, glucose-1-phosphate is activated to ADP-glucose using an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase before being transferred by starch synthase to a terminal glucose residue for elongation of a glucan chain. The ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is inhibited by inorganic phosphate and activated by the Calvin cycle intermediate, 3-phosphoglycerate. Cytosolic Pi is produced by sucrose synthesis and is exchanged with chloroplastic triose-phosphate by the triose phosphate-phosphate translocator. In contrast, if starch is synthesized in the cytosol of dinoflagellates, then no exchange of metabolites across the plastid membranes is required. Furthermore, multiple soluble starch synthases and one granule-bound starch synthase of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii, display a marked substrate preference for UDP-glucose rather than ADP-glucose. A similar preference is observed in all organisms storing starch in the cytosol, such as the rhodophytes, glaucophytes and cryptophytes. Thus, starch synthesis in dinoflagellates might proceed through a cytosolic UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, but characterization of this enzyme and its regulators will be required to validate this suggestion.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
PMC6040629_P023,"The origin of multicellularity in animals provided novel niches for bacteria to exploit, requiring the first animals to evolve new mechanisms for mediating interactions with pathogenic and commensal bacteria. In addition, the progenitors of animals interacted with bacteria – both as prey and pathogens – and the roots of animal innate immunity clearly predate animal origins. We have found that choanoflagellates express TLRs, transmembrane receptors that trigger the animal innate immune response, as well as its canonical downstream signaling target, NF-κB, suggesting that both existed in the Urchoanozoan (Figure 4a,c). Like modern choanoflagellates and sponges, the Urchoanozoan likely preyed upon bacteria, and bacterial cues can induce life history transitions in choanoflagellates, although the mechanisms by which choanoflagellates capture bacteria and sense bacterial cues are unknown. We hypothesize that the core TLR/NF-κB pathway functioned in prey sensing, immunity, or more complex processes in the Urchoanozoan that subsequently formed the basis of a self-defense system in animals. Because critical pathway members linking TLR and NF-κB appear to be animal innovations (e.g., MyD88), the animal signaling pathway may have evolved to diversify downstream signaling processes to tailor responses in a multicellular context. This pathway diversification may have included the evolution of roles in development, as TLRs have been implicated in both NF-κB-dependent and NF-κB-independent developmental signaling (in addition to their functions in immunity) in bilaterians and in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. The uncharacterized choanoflagellate-specific Kinase TLRs and Kinase TIRs (Figure 4b,c) may function as part of a streamlined signaling pathway that mediates responses to extracellular cues, including bacteria, although further research will be required to test this hypothesis.",choanoflagellates,bacteria,prey upon,predation,Choanoflagellata,Bacteria,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,TRUE,,NA
