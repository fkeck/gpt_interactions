PMC2565799_P022,"In Lycosa tarantula pre-copulatory cannibalism appears to be adaptive behaviour that has evolved to overcome negative effects of food limitation on female reproductive rate. Females that had cannibalized a single male produced more offspring with a better body condition. These females also laid their egg sacs sooner in the season, which promoted more rapid development because of warmer temperatures. A similar pattern was found in the wolf spider Pardosa milvina in which females fed high-quality diets in the laboratory produced eggs sacs more rapidly than females reared on a low-quality diet. The result is that earlier dispersal of the spiderlings of cannibalistic females allowed them to grow to a larger size by the end of the season. These effects of cannibalism were directly due to an alleviation of food limitation, and not due to any possible genetic correlation between cannibalistic behavior and aggressive foraging behavior for prey, because in Field Experiment 2 females in both treatments had killed a male. By permitting only half of these females, selected at random, to feed completely on the male that we offered to them, we ruled out any possibility that the benefit of a male as a meal to the cannibalistic female was a spurious artefact of the fact that females who tend to be more cannibalistic may be more aggressive and thereby more successful in capturing other prey. This benefit of cannibalism to the female is consistent with the fact that males are several times larger than alternative prey, which makes a single male a more valuable prey simply in terms of calorie content.",Pardosa milvina,Pardosa milvina,cannibalize,Consumption,Pardosa milvina,Pardosa milvina,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1
PMC2628885_P043,"The most common species, Aedes triseriatus, had the highest proportion occupancy and colonization, and species with low proportion occupancy also had low proportion colonization. Mosquito (Aedes triseriatus and Toxorhynchites rutilus) occupancy responded most strongly to water volume, consistent with Ellis et al. and our predictions. While occupancy-water volume slopes for Culicoides guttipennis and Helodes pulchella were significantly greater than zero, they were lower than the slopes for mosquitoes, which agrees with our prediction that these species would respond less strongly to changes in water volume. Further, Y-intercepts for the mosquitoes were not different from zero, indicating close to zero occupancy in treeholes with no standing water. The probability of occupancy for Culicoides guttipennis and Helodes pulchella is significantly greater than zero in treeholes with no standing water. This suggests a possible trade-off as non-mosquitoes have non-zero occupancy in nearly dry treeholes, allowing them to survive where two other species, one the numerically dominant species, and the other the top predator, cannot. Aedes triseriatus can quickly recolonize these patches when water refills them, but other species survive in these patches during drought. The quick recolonization by mosquitoes suggests rapid, global dispersal, and specialization in treeholes with different conditions suggests a possible trade-off between ability to survive in a habitat and colonization ability, as well as a mechanism for regional coexistence of species.",toxorynchites rutilus,aedes triseriatus,prey on,Predation,Rutilus,Ochlerotatus triseriatus,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,

PMC2718504_P041,"We investigated the recovery of irradiated Thermococcus gammatolerans cells in a rich medium containing peptides and S° (VSM-S°) and under nutrient-limiting conditions (20 amino acids supplemented with S° (ASW-S°)). In the latter case, cells became more sensitive to gamma rays, with a survival of only 0.001% at a dose of 7,500 Gy. In a rich culture medium, Deinococcus radiodurans and Deinococcus geothermalis withstand higher doses of irradiation than Thermococcus gammatolerans. On the other hand, in minimal culture medium, an irradiation dose of 3,000 Gy is lethal for Deinococcus radiodurans. Exponentially growing Thermococcus gammatolerans cells exhibit a similar behavior. Since Thermococcus gammatolerans is also able to grow in the presence of sugar and without S° (MAYTP), we tested here the viability of the cells in such growth conditions. Cell survival in both MAYTP and VSM-S° media are almost the same whatever the phase considered: 100% viability until 2,500 Gy and 0.1% survival at 7,500 Gy (Figure 7). The slight survival increase observed in VSM-S° compared to in MAYTP is probably due to a protective effect of the added sulfur in VSM-S°. We conclude from these observations that the radioresistance of Thermococcus gammatolerans is not drastically influenced by the metabolic pathways used (peptide degradation versus sugar-based metabolism) nor correlated with the generation time. Generation times in MAYTP and VSM-S° media differ: 5 h and 1.5 h, respectively. Figure 8 shows the kinetics of reconstitution of shattered chromosomes after a 2,500 Gy exposure (100% survival). Whereas 4 h were required for reconstitution when cells were grown in VSM-S°, 7 h were needed for cells recovering in MAYTP. As the survival rates are the same in both conditions, we confirmed that the speed of genome restoration after irradiation is not a key parameter for survival, at least in the growth conditions used. In a rich medium, the rates of irradiated DNA recovery appear to be slower than those reported for Deinococcus radiodurans. As shown in Table S17 in Additional data file 8, only a few repair genes in Thermococcus gammatolerans have homologues in both Deinococcus sequenced genomes, but archaeal DNA repair systems, as well as other mechanisms involved in DNA metabolism, are similar to their eukaryotic counterparts and not to those found in bacteria. Deinococcus radiodurans encodes efficient DNA repair systems but several proteins involved in these pathways remain to be identified. Analysis of the transcriptome of Deinococcus radiodurans revealed a group of genes that are up-regulated in response to either desiccation or ionizing radiation. The five most highly induced genes in response to each stress encode proteins of unknown function and their inactivation indicates that they play roles in radioresistance in recA-dependent and recA-independent processes, but none have homologues in Thermococcus gammatolerans. However, among hypothetical proteins, one cannot exclude the presence of functional analogues that play comparable roles in the cell. Despite increasing literature on this subject, DNA repair mechanisms in Archaea are less well documented than those found in bacteria. Many proteins, and sometimes entire pathways, are either missing or encoded by genes that remain to be identified. In every sequenced genome, approximately 20 to 30% of the genes are orphans or code for conserved proteins with unknown function, which may be specific DNA-interacting proteins still to be characterized.",Deinococcus radiodurans,Thermococcus gammatolerans,withstand higher doses of irradiation than,Competition,Deinococcus radiodurans,Thermococcus gammatolerans,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,

While prey density and biomass did not influence chick survival or brood movements, other physical or ecological characteristics of the different habitats may influence these reproductive parameters. Differences in predation pressure between habitats have been demonstrated to influence chick survival and brood movements in many species. Species exposed to predators can change their habitat use by moving to habitats with lower encounters with predators or they can aggregate in groups using various defence mechanisms to fend off predators. Competition also plays a role in chick survival and brood movements in shorebirds.

We noted the presence/absence of larger piscivores, including sharks, barracuda, groupers, snappers, and jacks, adjacent to our transects; at all study sites these fishes were uncommon to rare and, therefore, assumed not to be of primary importance to our analysis.We focused on small- to intermediate-sized piscivores, which included the smaller serranids and lutjanids, because they are the primary predators of adult and juvenile Stegastes planifrons. These smaller predators could themselves have been released by the overfishing of larger predators; thus, fishing pressure could actually be expected to result in fewer, rather than more, damselfishes. For example, Stallings found that the harvesting and depletion of Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus, allowed two smaller-bodied, intermediate predators (coney and graysby groupers, Cephalopholis fulva and Chrysiptera cruentata) to proliferate, which in turn had strong negative effects on their prey.

PMC2914020_P025,"The Mediterranean also differs from other deep-sea ecosystems in its species composition, notably the absence of the near-ubiquitous deep-water grenadier fish Coryphaenoides armatus and the amphipod Eurythenes gryllus. Instead, Acanthephyra eximia appears to have functionally replaced E. gryllus, the dominant deep-sea scavenging crustacean throughout most of the world's oceans. Acanthephyra eximia is likely to have entered the Mediterranean Sea within the last 5 million years following Pliocene flooding by waters through the Strait of Gibraltar. The Eastern deep basins formed roughly 2 million years ago, but stagnation precluded colonization for a long time. A certain degree of eurythermy may have allowed Acanthephyra eximia to become a dominant member of the Mediterranean abyssal community in the absence of the stenothermal amphipod Eurythenes gryllus. Barriers to colonization of the Mediterranean include the differences in temperature, salinity, and food supply between the Atlantic and Mediterranean, as well as the existence of shallow sills in the Strait of Gibraltar and Strait of Sicily. Despite these inferences and the relative youth of the system, a deep-sea fauna has developed, although it is depauperate compared with that of the oceans. Typical deep-water groups, such as echinoderms, glass sponges, and macroscopic Foraminifera (Xenophyophora), are scarce or absent in the deep basins of the Mediterranean. Other groups (i.e., fishes, decapod crustaceans, mysids, and gastropods) are much less abundant in the deep Mediterranean than in the northeastern Atlantic.",Acanthephyra eximia,Eurythenes gryllus,replace,Competition,Acanthephyra eximia,Eurythenes gryllus,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

Morphological differences found by Ocharan Larrondo in Iberian Calopteryx populations may be due to a character displacement phenomenon. This would be produced in species populations with low relative abundance. The aforementioned author described Calopteryx virgo meridionalis females with a dark wing phenotype in the central Iberian Peninsula (Mediterranean region), where this species has a low relative abundance. Moreover, he described Calopteryx xanthostoma females with reduced or no pseudopterostigma on the northern slopes of the Cantabrian range (Eurosiberian region), where this species also presents a low relative abundance. Finally, Ocharan described Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis asturica, a subspecies consigned to Cantabrian Eurosiberian populations (thermocoline belt), where its relative abundance is also low. A recent study focussing on Calopteryx virgo meridionalis and Calopteryx xanthostoma showed these differences once again in Iberian populations, from the northern slopes of the Cantabrian range to the central Iberian Peninsula (D.

In fact, coloration differences were found in secondary traits not only in females, but also in wing spot extension in males, showing an increase of pigmentation southwards. Differences show a clinal variation supported by clinal relative abundance.

PMC3166138_P051,"The extensive distribution of Pseudunela viatoris sp. nov. is surprising. Due to aforementioned reasons a distribution of larvae via water currents is not likely. An accidentally distribution of different ontogenetic stages after heavy (sub-)tropical storms is not very probable due to the large distances. We cannot exclude a man-made dispersal, where small patches of sand of neighboured populations were displaced e.g. by ships. More likely, however, there exist intermediate populations between those from Fiji and Indonesia that have not been discovered yet – or already got extinct. Missing intermediates and restricted gene flow across these stepping stones might also explain the slight anatomical differences between the Fijian specimens and those from Indonesia, such as the variation in the length of the copulatory stylets or the pigmentation of the eye. Possibly, small genetic distances observed between these distant populations also may reflect a stage of ongoing allopatric speciation. Finally, another aspect should be considered: juveniles of the amphidromous nerite snail Neritina asperulata Recluz, 1842 show a “hitchhiking” behaviour by attaching to the shell of the congeneric N. pulligera Linnaeus, 1758. In this way young specimens travel upstream for growth and reproduction. We can imagine that eggs and accordingly larval or adult acochlidians stick to e.g. benthic living organisms when the living conditions in the sand are changing for the worse and thus, may be displaced into another habitat.",Neritina asperulata,Neritina pulligera,hitchhike,Commensalism,Neritina asperulata,Neritina pulligera,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,
PMC3246438_P041,"In spite of this incongruence in the spatial genetic structures, the AMOVA performed on the plant dataset significantly showed that a part of the plant molecular variance (3%; Table 3) could be significantly explained by the species identity of its main pollinators, which provides support to our third hypothesis. AMOVAs allow evaluation and testing of the proportions of the molecular variance explained by a priori defined grouping factors. However, they have rarely been used in the field of comparative phylogeography, with the exception of a study on the Yucca - Yucca moth interaction, for which molecular variance of a given species was explained by that of another species with levels ranging from 2.5% to 17%. Our result for the proportion of the plant genetic structure explained by pollinator species composition (i.e., 3%) is thus rather at the lower margin of the results found for the Yucca-Yucca moth interaction. Still, one should keep in mind that since the Arum maculatum - psychodid interaction is antagonistic, in contrast to the mutualistic Yucca - Yucca moth interaction, results from this and our study are hardly comparable. Our AMOVA results should thus be considered as an innovative first examination of the ecological factors explaining the respective genetic structure of antagonistic organisms. They particularly show that pollinators have and/or have had some effect on the phylogeographic history of the plant. If the correlation proposed by our AMOVA is causal, it would indicate that the spatial genetic structure of Arum maculatum is being shaped by the variation in the biological characteristics (e.g., dispersal abilities, ecological niches) of psychodid pollinators. This relates to one of the principles of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. For instance, Psycha grisescens seems more restricted to a narrowly defined region, and thus appears as a less mobile or more ecologically selective species than Psychoda phalaenoides, a result that is paralleled by the diversity analyses (Figs. 2B and 3B). Another explanation for differences in structure and diversity patterns might be that during glacial periods, each insect species was independently sharing refugia with different plant lineages. For example, it could be proposed that while Psychoda phalaenoides was mainly restricted to the western part of the glacial plant distribution, Psycha grisescens was more abundant in the south-eastern part, allowing thus some adaptation to each of the two currently observed plant lineages. During this period, each of the plant lineages could have evolved to adapt to the most frequent insect present in the area. The correlation we currently observe between the plant spatial genetic structure and the respective distributions of the two insect species would thus be a consequence of a recent coevolutionary process. Due to the fact that this interaction involves physiological features such as odour composition, which are key for the specific pollinator attraction, investigating the volatile compounds found in the different plant lineages could further clarify this point.",yucca moth,yucca,interact with,Mutualism,Tegeticula yuccasella,Yucca,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1

All of the localities where the mice had this mite are located within the Valdivian rain forest phytogeographical region. Presumably the mites occur on the same rodent species on the western side of the Andes Mountains in Chile in this same floristic region, thus is probably not of special conservation concern due to a small geographical distribution. But the total extent of the range of this mite remains to be determined. The main host species, Abrothrix longipilis, has a much larger total range than where we found this new mite. Further studies of the ectoparasites of this rodent will be required to determine whether the mite and this host have co–equal ranges. We have one limited bit of information suggesting that the mite may not co–occur with all populations of Abrothrix longipilis. Four individuals of this mouse that were collected at Parque Nacional Laguna Blanca (39°3'S, 70°21'W) did not have Haemogamasus alongipilis. This national park is located in the Occidental District of the Patagonian semi–desert region that is characterized by the growth of perennial bunch grasses and low–growing shrubs, rather than trees. In this arid environment the Abrothrix longipilis are limited to microhabitats of dense growths of the bunch grasses or along the margins of isolated streams and seepages. The absence of Haemogamasus alongipilis from these four Abrothrix longipilis collections could be because the mite cannot survive the off–host phase of its life cycle in this general environment that is much less humid than that of the Valdivian rain forests.",Haemogamasus alongipilis,Abrothrix longipilis,parasitize,Parasitism,Haemogamasus,Abrothrix longipilis,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

Although favoured in pre-copulatory sexual competition (intimidation or fighting), males with disproportionately large chelae release fewer sperm and thus may be disfavoured by post-copulatory sexual selection either in the form of sperm competition or cryptic female choice. In fact, this handicap may promote cryptic female choice for males that are better able to trade efficiency in pre-copulatory sexual competition (chelae size) with efficiency in post copulatory sexual selection (ejaculate size and quality): males that do not grow chelae disproportionately larger than their carapace could be favoured by post-copulatory sexual selection.",cherax dispar,cherax dispar,intimidate,Competition,Cherax dispar,Cherax dispar,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

PMC3490757_P012,"The time: a couple of billion years ago, the place: a submarine hydrothermal vent, the players: the ancestors of Ignicoccus, Nanoarchaeum, as well as the α-proteobacterial precursor of the mitochondrion. Others have undertaken explanations of how life itself likely got its start at this very location. Recent studies have demonstrated that archaea such as Ignicoccus and Nanoarchaeum equitans still live in close association with α-proteobacteria in such areas. This latter group would be expected to be thermo-tolerant to some degree in order to establish an endosymbiotic relationship with the pair of thermophilic archaea. It is interesting that almost all thermophilic forms of α-proteobacteria characterized to date are in the order Rhizobiales, a not-so-distant relative of the Rickettsiales from which mitochondria are presumably derived. This is, then, in the quite literal sense, an extreme hypothesis, since all the participants lived at high temperatures. That is not to say that there didn’t have to be a considerable amount of compromise to make this arrangement work. Current thermophilic α-proteobacteria have an optimum growth temperature around 50°C, whereas Ignicoccus does not typically grow below 75°C. Nanoarchaeum equitans, for its part, has a G-C content of only 31.6%, compared to Ignicoccus’ 56.5% and thus has a melting temperature well below that of Ignicoccus’ optimum temperature, making it a rather poor thermophile in the first place. The arrival of an α-proteobacterial endosymbiont may have been linked with the breakage of a venting chimney spire which may have then eased the new consortium into a lower growing temperature than the archaea had been previously used to. Ignicoccus has an interesting response to being grown at sub-optimal temperatures- it shuts down the biosynthetic processes leading to tetraether formation, thus changing the makeup of its inner membrane. Martin has hypothesized that the bacterial membrane synthesis pathway eventually replaced that of its archaeal partners and points out that an archaeal-derived isoprene synthesis pathway still exists in eukaryotes but has been adapted for the synthesis of sterols, quinone tails, and dolichol phosphate instead of lipids per se[101]. Concerning membranes, opponents of endosymbiotic theories claim that phagocytosis must be a prerequisite for internalizing other microbes, something that has not been seen in any prokaryote to date. Others, however, attest that a tear in a membrane may have opened up the host to invasion. Electron microscopic studies have actually revealed defects in both Ignicoccus membranes in the form of fractures appearing in non-contiguous membranes, although it is not clear whether this was an artifact of preparation or not. In addition to this, Ignicoccus was recently shown to have cell surface appendages which may act in adhesion. Ignicoccus may thus have inadvertently captured an α-proteobacteria as cooler seawater rushed in to a broken chimney spire and then engulfed it via a nearby tear in the outer cellular membrane. Regardless of the precise mechanism, once the bacterium was engulfed, it effectively created two very different compartments within the archaeal host. The former cytoplasm contained within the inner membrane now effectively became the nucleus and the former massive periplasm now became the new cytoplasm. It was this partitioning effect that first piqued the interest of Rachel and Huber when they proposed that Ignicoccus would make a good host. This partitioning led to another interesting effect- archaeal 80 S ribosomes were now contained within the nucleus, requiring an export of either themselves or at least their protein products into the nascent cytoplasm. Luckily, the inner (now effectively the nuclear) membrane was able to bud vesicles out into the new cytoplasm. This arrangement could explain the problem of which came first, the nucleus or the nuclear pores. Some have pointed out that the former is useless without the latter as well as vice versa. From this model, it would seem that the nucleus initially achieved import and export by vesicle budding, a role that was later delegated to the ER when the nuclear pores developed. It has recently been discussed that coated vesicles and nuclear pore complexes might share a common evolutionary origin. The initial need to export ribosomes into the cytoplasm may explain the somewhat convoluted system which still exists in eukaryotes today- the components of ribosomes are encoded for in the nucleus, the mRNA for ribosomal proteins is then exported into the cytoplasm, translated, and the resulting proteins are imported back into the nucleus for ribosome assembly, followed by the final export of ribosomes back into the cytoplasm.",Ignicoccus,Nanoarchaeum equitans,associate with,Symbiosis,Ignicoccus,Nanoarchaeum equitans,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,

PMC3518463_P034,"Unlike our predictions, however, amounts of biofilm did not differ among treatments. The absence of differences in amounts of chlorophyll a between plots with or without macroalgae was surprising. One possible explanation is that biofilms were grazed to a minimum in all treatments. This is, however, unlikely because amounts of biofilm in all treatments increased throughout the experiment. In addition, the method for estimating amounts of chlorophyll is most reliable when calibrated for surfaces of smooth, unshaded rock. Such surfaces formed only a small percentage of the plots (and were often limpet home scars), the remainder being encrusted with barnacles, algae or lichens or shaded by the cage. Some species of limpet cannot move or feed over encrusting organisms such as barnacles. Given the densities of limpets and covers of encrusting organisms on the shores used in the present study, it is unlikely that this is the case for Patella vulgata. There is also evidence that in some situations, Patella vulgata also feed directly on Fucus with fragments of leathery macroalgae often prevalent in gut contents. Sampling from the small proportion of the area that was ‘bare’ rock may not have been representative of the actual amounts of biofilm available as food to grazing limpets. Were it possible to quantify reliably amounts of chlorophyll a on the highly rugose surface of barnacles or on macroalgae, differences in amounts of microbial food among treatments may become apparent. Finally, the method used in the present study quantified standing stock of biofilm, not productivity. It is possible that productivity of biofilms did differ with presence/absence of Fucus and this may explain differences in growth. The lack of differences in standing stocks among the different treatments of limpets for either condition suggests that this is unlikely, but do not rule it out.",patella vulgata,fucus,feed on,Herbivory,Patella vulgata,Fucus,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

PMC3534711_P034,"Wood logs that sink beyond the photosynthetic zone of the ocean provide large amounts of organic matter to the oligotrophic deep sea. However, very few organisms can directly degrade wood and use it as an energy and carbon source, because the degradation of cellulose and lignin requires specific digestive enzymes. Furthermore, the degradation of cellulose is generally absent or slow under anoxic conditions. Accordingly, it is known that sunken ships preserve well in cold, salty, anoxic environments. The experiments in the Eastern Mediterranean deep sea showed that wood can be quickly localized and colonized by deep-sea fauna as well as by bacterial communities within a few months of deposition (Figure 8). Wood-boring bivalves play a key role in the initial degradation of the wood, the dispersal of wood chips and fecal matter around the wood log, and the provision of colonization surfaces to other organisms. In our experiments, wood-boring bivalves of the species Xylophaga dorsalis had fully colonized the wood in large numbers after one year (Figure 3a). They were responsible for the rapid degradation and littering of wood chips and fecal matter around the wood log, which lead to enhanced respiration rates and the emergence of sulfidic zones (Figure 8). In addition, Xylophaga dorsalis provided colonization surfaces for other organisms that were attracted to the wood, such as polychaetes and sipunculids. Wood-boring bivalves may therefore be considered a keystone species in wood fall habitats, as they transform the energy stored in the wood into nutrients that can be digested by other animals, either as feed for predators and scavengers or by their fecal pellets which are used by detritus-feeders.",Xylophaga dorsalis,polychaetes,provide colonization surfaces,Commensalism,Xylophaga dorsalis,Polychaeta,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

In a recent meta-analysis, Götzenberger et al. found no evidence that competition has shaped plant distributions at broad spatial extents, but also concluded that the data were insufficient to test this based on their analysis of the meta-data from 91 articles. Further research is needed in this area to provide conclusive evidence. One example that may suggest competition at broad spatial scales is a study of two congeneric heathland shrub species (genus Ulex) which show strong negative associations at three spatial scales of investigation. The authors suggest that over the ranges of these Ulex species competitive superiority is probably determined by climate, whereas at range margins other physical factors (e.g. soil) might drive the outcome of competition. The ability of some plants to grow and reproduce in botanical gardens under other climatic conditions has also been interpreted to suggest that biotic interactions restrict their natural distributions, although the role of other factors in such studies often cannot be fully disentangled from the biotic interaction signal. Specific life forms in plants can potentially influence the species ranges of other life forms. For instance, species-specific facilitative interactions among vascular epiphytes and trees suggest that trees' geographic ranges might strongly influence epiphytes' geographic ranges. Further facilitative effects among plants have been implied in the diversification of modern ferns which seem to have benefited from the more complex canopy structure of angiosperm trees relative to gymnosperms. For competitive interactions, pollen records indicate that the natural reforestation of central and northern Europe after the postglacial period probably forced the shade-intolerant shrub Hippophaë rhamnoides (Fig. 3D) to contract its formerly large geographic range to marginal tree less habitats in this region. Competition has also been proposed to have a role in shaping communities as inferred from pollen records of forest succession during Quaternary interglacials, where light-demanding pioneer shrub and dwarf-shrub species were first replaced by light-demanding and taller pioneer trees and then by shade-tolerant late-successional tree species. Studies of local interactions between Artemisia tridentata and Pinus ponderosa present competition as a process contributing to post-Pleistocene replacement of conifer forests in the Great Basin with desert shrubs. Other examples involving disturbances come from grasses which can exclude trees from dry regions by causing an increase in fire frequency. Moreover, during the shift from the wet Tertiary period to the dry Quaternary that saw the development of most global deserts, evidence from palaeobotanical, ecological, and phylogenetic analyses, support the hypothesis that a large number of ancient Tertiary species in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems persisted through facilitative or “nurse” effects with modern Quaternary species.",plants,plants,compete,Competition,Embryophyta,Embryophyta,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

Therefore, the role of these R-bodies in these diverse bacterial remains puzzling. A recent study has shown the presence of Reb homologs in the genome of the rhizobiale Azorhizobium caulinodans, a microsymbiont of the tropical legume Sesbania rostrata. Interestingly, deletion of the putative transcription factor praR caused aberrant nodule formation and was linked to greater expression of the reb locus. On the contrary, a double reb and praR mutant had a restored wild-type nodule formation. The authors hypothesized that praR is essential to suppress the killer trait conferred by the reb locus and establish symbiosis between Azorhizobium caulinodans and Sesbania rostrata. However, it is not known whether Azorhizobium caulinodans is able to make R-bodies.

PMC3586621_P005,"Lampropholis delicata is a small-sized skink [adult snout-vent length (SVL) 35–51 mm] that is native to eastern Australia. It was first detected in New Zealand in the mid-1960s at the Otahuhu railyards in south Auckland and is thought to have arrived as a stowaway in a shipment of wooden railway sleepers. We have provided support for this hypothesis previously, showing that the established New Zealand populations of Lampropholis delicata resulted from one or more successful introductions from a forestry region in inland northern New South Wales, near Tenterfield. Its introduction seems to have been localized to the Auckland region for approximately 15 years before rapidly spreading across the northern North Island. It is still expanding its range in the North Island, with bioclimatic modelling indicating that it has the potential to spread throughout much of the North Island and into some regions of the South Island. Lampropholis delicata is also invasive in the Hawaiian Islands and Lord Howe Island. It is thought to have rapidly displaced the resident moth skink (Lipinia noctua) soon after its arrival in Hawaii and has the potential to adversely impact the diverse native New Zealand lizard fauna owing to its rapid maturity (approximately 1 year), high annual reproductive output, extreme population densities and ability to thrive in areas with human disturbance and introduced mammals.",Lampropholis delicata,Lipinia noctua,displace,Competition,Lampropholis delicata,Ornithuroscincus noctua,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

For example, phenazine antibiotics produced by Pseudomonas aureofaciens have been shown to protect wheat from take-all, a disease caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici.

PMC3862729_P032,"At a smaller spatial scale however, hydrology has been subjected to significant anthropogenic modification. For example, an extensive network of flood mitigation drains have been constructed throughout the Millicent Coast region. This alteration to the natural hydrology has drained wetlands, and reduced the incidence of flooding by directing surface water to several new coastal outlets. The natural path of flood waters parallel to the coast has therefore been disrupted and isolated coastal populations are now less likely to be linked by floods. As a result, re-colonisation following local extirpation events is unlikely to occur. In many ways the modified hydrological regime described above simulates the drier climate and reduction in frequency of flooding predicted for the wider southeast coastal region under future climate change scenarios, which may have implications for Nannoperca obscura conservation. Indeed, since samples were collected for this study, several Central ESU populations have come under threat or become extirpated. There is also more recent evidence of an increase in the incidence of hybridisation with the co-distributed Nannoperca australis at some locations and this may be interpreted as a symptom of populations under environmental stress.

The habitat of Parastrachia japonensis was restricted to early-stage secondary forests in foothill areas. This insect is a specialist feeder that utilizes drupes of the Olacaceous tree, Schoepfia jasminodora, as its sole food resource. It requires good shade and usually forms aggregations on the underside of hard waxy leaves for summer estivation. In winter, the consolidated, massive aggregations enter into the large soil holes under leaf litter for hibernation. In the PCA, the first component was associated with temperature and precipitation, whereas the second was related to sunshine. In the ENM, 2 significant variables were identified for Parastrachia japonensis, including precipitation in the driest month and the lowest weekly radiation.

Consistent with past observations the cox1 sequences assigned amicronucleates to Tetrahymena borealis, Tetrahymena elliotti, and Tetrahymena tropicalis, as well as to species previously known only from micronucleate isolates (see below). The remaining 97 amicronucleate isolates differed by >4% from type strains and therefore were designated as putative new species (see Methods).

PMC4070932_P033,"Despite their excellent predictive performance according to AUC, our ensemble models do demonstrate some systematic errors. For example the models overestimate the native range of both Nerodia species, extending the range of Nerodia fasciata north of the Gulf coastal plain in Alabama and Mississippi and Nerodia sipedon into areas west of its known range. This over-prediction is likely due to our method of pseudo-absence selection. Because we created models using museum records and haphazardly collected observations, we had no true absence data and had to generate pseudo-absences outside the known range of these species. To prevent the model from under-predicting the suitable area for these species, we only selected pseudo-absences that are at a minimum 2 degrees distance from known occurrences. This prevents the SDMs from training on any data in the intervening area between the presence localities and pseudo-absences, and due to the climatic similarity between adjacent occupied and unoccupied areas, the models predict the area as suitable. An interesting question, but one outside the focus of this study, is whether some of these areas are in fact suitable for one species in the absence of the other. For example, is the Gulf Coast of South Carolina suitable for Nerodia sipedon climatically, with only competition from Nerodia fasciata preventing it from expanding its range into this region? The ensemble model for Nerodia sipedon also slightly under-predicts its native range, with low suitability in eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin.

PMC4207960_P029,"Plant regrowth after grazing is affected by nutrient and light availability. The reduced amount of Elodea after grazing may have lost competition for nutrients from phytoplankton and epiphyton which possibly induced light limitation for macrophyte (re)growth, but we cannot test this because algal density (chlorophyll a concentration) and epiphyton load were not elevated under fertilized conditions. In the case of epiphyton, there was even less in the fertilized ponds, probably due to the grazing pressure by snails. Also, light availability in the fertilized ponds was still rather high (minimum 20 % of ambient light on the bottom of the shallow pond) considering that Elodea sp. plants can still grow under very low light availability, also after being cut from the mother plant. Possibly, snail grazing prevented recovery of Elodea after duck grazing, as snails can inhibit sprouting of plants and thus regeneration, when present in high enough densities. Furthermore, grazing by invertebrates and waterfowl has been shown to induce reallocation of resources to belowground plant parts and subsequent early senescence in above-sediment plant material in several macrophyte species. This may, therefore, also be an explanation for limited above-sediment recovery of grazed plants. Whereas herbivores can change the nutrient availability by importing nutrients from elsewhere, through the consumption of plants and return of nutrients via faeces, we did not find evidence of enhanced nutrient availability as the nutrient concentration was not elevated in the water column nor in the macrophytes after the presence of the ducks in both nutrient treatments.

PMC4326405_P051,"Current literature and the knowledge of the historical biogeography of Alces and other ungulates may support an exclusive contemporary association of Varestrongylus alces to the Eurasian moose; potentially suggesting a deep historical association with this host. Historically, during the Pleistocene, Alces was sympatric with other cervids including Cervus elaphus, Capreolus capreolus, and Rangifer tarandus in several temperate refugia within Eurasia. Coincidentally, all these cervids are hosts for other Varestrongylus species in Eurasia or North America. Additionally, this historical host sympatry indicates the long-term co-existence of different Varestrongylus/Cervidae assemblages, which support an early diversification within the parasite genus, perhaps congruent to ungulate diversification. Alternatively, this extensive sympatry and diversity of the mammalian megafauna may also have facilitated the occurrence of host-switching among ungulate hosts. Glacial cycles during the Pleistocene caused the extinction of multiple elements of this mammalian community and promoted isolation in different refugia, also altering patterns of sympatry of cervid hosts of Varestrongylus species, as mentioned above. As proposed by Hoberg et al., increased allopatry and host extinction events could have: (i) resulted in lowered diversity in certain parasite groups, as in the monospecific genus Umingmakstrongylus Hoberg, Polley, Gunn & Nishi, 1995, or (ii) constituted a determinant of post-glacial isolation and allopatric speciation of certain parasites, which may be the case of the diverse genus Varestrongylus.",Varestrongylus alces,Alces,associate with,Parasitism,Varestrongylus alces,Alces,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

More recently, related genotypes (Theileria buffeli C, Theileria sinensis-like) were found in African buffalo but not in cattle from the same geographic regions in southern Africa. All these genotypes are generally considered to be genotypic variants of Theileria buffeli, even though host specificity, clinical presentation and specific geographic distributions are different.

For example, larger larvae of the bryozoan Bugula neritina had a more variable swimming period before settlement compared to smaller ones and, although small and large larvae were capable of settling, smaller larvae settled sooner than larger larvae. Similarly, a field study showed that the size of settlers in the bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata was larger on rough surfaces, compared to smooth plates, which suggested that smaller larvae were less selective for habitat. Based on our study, it is likely that the effects of larva size on swimming time could be levelled in the presence of a strong settlement inducer (optimal conditions) from the onset. However, the size-related variability in settlement behaviors among sibling larvae of Urticina felina may serve as a dispersal strategy, that is, to maintain recruitment of some offspring (smaller in size) closer to the parental habitat (philopatry), while allowing the larger ones to disperse more widely, particularly when incentives for settlement are weaker (e.g., suboptimal environment, competition, predation). In brooding species that release fully formed larvae within a short time, such as Urticina felina, this strategy may have evolved to decrease the intrinsic effects of competition among sibling settlers. Offspring size variation as a strategy to decrease intraspecies competition has been reported in other marine invertebrates. For instance, larger egg size corresponded to longer planktonic period in three lecithotrophic species, the ascidians Phallusia obesa and Ciona intestinalis and the echinoid Heliocidaris erythrogramma, suggesting that offspring from large eggs would disperse further than those from small eggs and that spreading of offspring may decrease intraspecific competition.",urticina felina,urticina felina,decrease competition among,Competition,Urticina felina,Urticina felina,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1

PMC4403775_P001,"Phenotypic plasticity is the ability to produce different phenotypes under different environmental conditions and to respond to changes in environmental conditions. This phenomenon has long been studied by evolutionary biologists interested in its adaptive significance. One particular type of phenotypic plasticity is that displayed as an inducible defense, which is stimulated directly by cues associated with a predation threat. Predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in anuran tadpoles has been extensively studied. Anuran tadpoles exhibit a range of inducible morphological changes, such as heightened tail depth, in the presence of a threat by various types of pond dwelling predator such as dragonfly larvae. Tadpoles with a heightened tail depth phenotype show higher survival rates when dragonfly larvae are present. Rana pirica tadpoles display a unique bulgy morph when exposed to their main predator, larval salamander Hynobius retardatus. The inducible bulgy morphology is believed to be an evolutionary defense against the gape-limited Hynobius retardatus larvae under an intimate predator–prey relationship; the bulgy morph is only induced by a predation threat from larval salamanders and functions to prevent the tadpoles from being swallowed.",Hynobius retardatus,Rana pirica tadpoles,threaten,Predation,Hynobius retardatus,Rana pirica,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

These results imply that macrocercous cercaria of Echinochasmus sp. may be attributed to the genus Stephanoprora Odhner, 1902. According to Kostadinova, data on the life histories of some Echinochasminae species tend to support the affiliation of species to Stephanoprora rather than to Echinochasmus on the presence of a long-tailed cercarial stage. On the other hand, Stephanoprorapseudoechinata is a marine species, while Echinochasmus sp. Stanevičiūtė et al. 2008 is a parasite of freshwater organisms, a finding that shows a considerable ecological plasticity in this group. Sudarikov and Karmanova stated that the ontogenetic character state of Echinochasminae species concerning the absence of well-developed collar with collar spines in the morphology of cercaria, indicates that echinochasmids is a more ancient group than other echinostomatids. The phylogenetic relationships estimated by ITS2 and 28S sequences partly support this hypothesis, because Echinochasmus sp. Stanevičiūtė et al. 2008 and Stephanoprorapseudoechinata were clustered in one clade with Sphaeridiotremaglobulus (Psilostomidae) in the 28S tree. Cribb et al. stated that from 144 known life cycles of Echinostomatidae species about two-thirds of the first intermediate hosts are lymnaeoid pulmonates but there are also significant numbers of species developing in prosobranchs. Ecological preferences of Echinostomatidae species suggest that there has been a strong co-evolution with the Lymnaeoidea and a less frequent association with a few prosobranch taxa. On the contrary, all 18 species of Echinochasmus with known life cycles are restricted to prosobranchs. Echinoparyphiummordwilkoi, that shows a separate position from Echinochasmus in the molecular analyses (Figs 2, 3), is restricted to the lower heterobranch Valvatapiscinalis (Valvatoidea). Most of Psilostomidae species also admit for the first intermediate host a prosobranch snail, except those ones belonging to the genus Ribeiroia Travastos, 1939, which position in this family is questionable.

PMC4505326_P001,"Annelids are a taxon of marine lophotrochozoans with mainly segmented members showing a huge diversity of body plans1. One of the most speciose taxa is the Syllidae, which are further well-known for their diverse reproductive modes. There are two reproductive modes in Syllidae, called epigamy and schizogamy, and both modes involve strong anatomical and behavioural changes. Epigamy is considered the plesiomorphic reproductive mode. It results in significant morphological and behavioural changes in the benthic, sexually mature adults2, which undergo enlargement of anterior appendages and eyes and development of swimming notochaetae in midbody-posterior segments. Notochaetae are absent in non-reproductive syllids, which only bear neurochaetae for locomotion. Transformed individuals actively ascend to the pelagic realm where spawning occurs. After spawning, the animals usually die, though some are able to reverse these changes and go back to the benthic realm for further reproductive activity. Schizogamy, the putatively derived mode, produces reproductive individuals or stolons from newly produced posterior segments. The stolons develop eyes and their own anterior appendages, as well as special swimming (noto-) chaetae, while they maintain attached to the parental body. When they are completely mature, they are detached from the parental stock for swimming and spawning2345. Finally, the stolons die after spawning. Meanwhile, the stock remains in the benthic realm, thereby avoiding the dangers of swimming into the pelagic zone, and will be able to reproduce more than once. Schizogamy can be subdivided into scissiparity (only one stolon is developed in a reproductive cycle), or gemmiparity (several stolons are developed simultaneously during the same reproductive cycle)345. Some gemmiparous syllids, like Myrianida Milne Edwards, 1845 (a member of Autolytinae), are able to produce a series of stolons, one after another (Fig. 1A), with the last one being the most developed and the first to be detached6. Another type of gemmiparity has been described for some species of Syllinae: Trypanosyllis Claparède, 1864, Trypanobia Imajima & Hartmann, 1964 (Recently erected from subgenus to genus level), and Parahaplosyllis Hartmann-Schröder, 19907891011121314151617. These animals are able to produce numerous stolons in collateral or successive budding, i.e. growing dorsally or laterodorsally from the last segment or from several posterior most segments (Fig. 1B–D). In addition, Trypanosyllis and Trypanobia have been reported to live in a symbiotic association with other animals, like echinoderms and sponges.

PMC4553507_P003,"Another biological control strategy against invasive insect pests is the use of entomopathogenic fungi. Special attention has been given to entomopathogenic fungal research because they have the ability to penetrate through the insect’s cuticle. A significant research initiative began in the 1990s in Vermont directed towards development of entomopathogenic fungi for exotic insects impacting forest health, including pear thrips, hemlock woolly adelgid, elongate hemlock scale, and European fruit lecanium scale. Numerous fungal isolates including Lecanicillium lecanii, Hirsutella spp., Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, Mariannaea sp. and others have been recovered from infected pear thrips. Other fungal isolates have been found to be associated with elongate hemlock scale and lecanium scale. These entomopathogenic agents offer an opportunity for biological regulation of exotic invasive species, especially when the fungal pathogens are found associated with epizootic processes, where a rapid decline of the pest population is occurring.

PMC4553566_P012,"Insects, including fruit flies, defend themselves against parasitoids through various immune mechanisms such as encapsulation. In a majority of parasitoids, egg and first larval stage development is often very rapid, and voracious feeding early in their development may be a means acquiring critical resources before the host can mount a defensive response. If radiation could compromise the host immune system, then a greater proportion of parasitoids might complete their development. It is known that radiation can damage the capacity of certain insect hosts to defend themselves and consequently a parasitoid may not confront fully competent resistance. For example, irradiation of the lepidopteran hosts of the braconid Cotesia flavipes (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) increased parasitism rates. Some evidence likewise indicates that fruit fly larvae are immunologically compromised, thus radiation can result in a higher percent of parasitoid emergence. Diachasmimorpha longicaudata emergence and females-biased sex ratio increased following exposure of both Ceratitis capitata and Anastrepha fraterculus hosts to X-ray doses of between 20 Gy and 100 Gy.

PMC4624237_P003,"Seagrasses are foundation species that form highly productive meadows, which provide valuable ecosystem services such as food and habitat to a large number of associated organisms, oxygen production, and sink for CO2 emissions. They posses a variety of secondary metabolites that may act as chemical defences, and exhibit a high phenotypic plasticity in their physiological, structural and biomechanical responses to environmental stressors. We therefore expect seagrasses to induce defences against herbivory, a fact that to our knowledge has not been demonstrated so far. Compared to the extensive knowledge on terrestrial plants and seaweeds, our understanding of the grazer-induced defences in seagrasses is scarce. The few studies conducted on seagrasses have shown no induction of anti-herbivory defences in response to direct grazing by macrograzers or to simulated herbivory. However, small herbivores (mesograzers) rather than macrograzers or simulated herbivory are expected to trigger the induction of anti-herbivory defences. Mesograzers have reduced home ranges and inflict a gradual removal of selected tissues over a prolonged period, whereas macrograzers can consume entire plant individuals in a short feeding attack and do not stay on the same plant long enough to suffer the induced response. Similarly, grazer-damage has been reported to induce a different plant response than physical damage alone. Despite these indications, in a recent study, Steele and Valentine found no induced change in the palatability of two tropical seagrass species to the isopod Paracerceis caudata after a 15-day induction experiment. Therefore, in order to understand the general significance of inducible defences in seagrasses we first need to provide a solid assessment of whether mesograzers are able to induce defences that deter consumption and how this may vary among different seagrass and mesograzer species.",Paracerceis caudata,seagrasses,consume,Herbivory,Paracerceis caudata,Halophila,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

Again, the overlap is statistically significant (P = 0.018) for only one growth phase, i.e., the mycelium (Table 2). Thus, it would appear that even thermally regulated species may have established different strategies to grow either in yeast form or in mycelium phase. As previously mentioned, Histoplasma capsulatum and Candida albicans have contrasting responses to temperature as incubation at 37° induces yeast growth in the former but triggers filamentation in the latter. Moreover, in Candida albicans, both phases are found at 37°; it is the combination of multiple factors that determine which growth phase will be favored. In the study by Bruno et al., filamentation was induced by adding serum to the medium at 37°. Thus, sharing the same host is not sufficient to induce similar regulation of the expression of orthologs. In this case, the phylogenetic distance between Histoplasma capsulatum and Candida albicans may also account for the small degree of overlap between overexpressed orthologs in yeast and mycelial phases. With the development of current technologies, closer plant and human pathogen models may be developed in the future and allow us to better understand how filamentation evolved and its relationship with ecology, for instance, in the phylogenetic group of Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.

This threat is in addition to those already mentioned for the Bahama Oriole: lethal yellowing disease of the favored Coconut Palm nesting habitat, brood parasitism by the recently arrived Shiny Cowbird, and ongoing habitat loss. Translocation of individuals to other areas may decrease the probability of extinction by reducing vulnerability to natural disasters. Our study suggests that translocation of Bahama Orioles from Andros to Abaco Island, where the species formerly occurred, should include individuals from North Andros, Mangrove Cay, and South Andros to maximize genetic diversity in the translocated population. Translocated individuals may experience stress, delayed breeding, decreased clutch size, and increased mortality risk. Inbreeding and diminished genetic diversity within the translocated population may also result. Thus, this conservation tool should be used with much caution and careful planning. Nevertheless, translocation can be an effective strategy to restore or supplement populations if individuals are carefully chosen, release areas are selected and prepared properly, and effective habitat management is practiced.",shiny cowbird,bahama oriole,parasitize,Parasitism,Molothrus bonariensis,Icterus northropi,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

PMC4712936_P006,"Here, we use dietary manipulation to determine the effects of oxidative damage and antioxidant protection on the association between lifespan and reproduction in male and female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus commodus. In the wild, these generalist omnivorous eat foliage, seeds and seedlings and also cannibalize one another. Crickets are an excellent model for examining the link between reproduction, aging and lifespan because reproductive effort can be easily measured in both sexes. In females, reproductive effort can be measured by counting eggs while in males, it can be quantified through measuring how long males spend calling to attract a mate. This energetically expensive behavior is associated with a four-fold increase in metabolic rate and is a primary determinant of how many mates male crickets attract in natural populations. Our ability to easily measure reproductive effort in both sexes means that crickets have been used as a model to explore the effects of nutrition of lifespan and reproduction. Maklakov et al. showed that in Teleogryllus commodus, reproduction and lifespan are expressed best in crickets that eat different amounts and blends of key nutrients. Specifically, reproductive effort is highest in females that eat equal amounts of protein and carbohydrate and in males that consume a carbohydrate rich diet. Both sexes, however, live longest when eating low protein, high carbohydrate diets. Sex-specific dietary optima mean that we can use diet to independently manipulate life-history traits in either sex and assay correlated changes in oxidative damage and protection.",Teleogryllus commodus,Teleogryllus commodus,cannibalize,Predation,Teleogryllus commodus,Teleogryllus commodus,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

PMC4726424_P037,"Our observation suggests that FW gastropods, especially Theodoxus fluviatilis fluviatilis, have one additional, peculiar function in the biology of Pneophyllum cetinaensis. This alga, like other red algae, does not have a vagile life stage and is constantly facing washout in the river stream. As most adult gastropods (more than 95% in the type locality) are overgrown by crusts of Pneophyllum cetinaensis, commonly with developed reproductive organs (Fig. 2e), they serve as the main dispersal vector of Pneophyllum cetinaensis through the river. In areas with no algal encrustation on pebbles, such as the slightly eutrophic part of the river in the vicinity of the town of Trilj (Fig. 1a), the algae can be found on gastropods, indicating an affinity of spores to attach onto gastropod shells and/or gastropod mobility. Most gastropod species can actively move upstream from 0.3 to 1.0 km per year49. Over periods of tens to hundreds of years, benthic molluscs could have dispersed Pneophyllum cetinaensis over a distance of 75 km along the river, even surmounting waterfalls (up to 50 m high). Such pronounced malacochory is also benefited by one more peculiarity of karst rivers: a high predominance of gastropods among benthic macroinvertebrates50. In the area of the type locality (Fig. 1), gastropods represent around 40% of the total number of benthic macroinvertebrates, with a maximum density of almost 4,500 specimens m−2 47.",Theodoxus fluviatilis fluviatilis,Pneophyllum cetinaensis,disperse,Mutualism,Theodoxus fluviatilis fluviatilis,Pneophyllum cetinaensis,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

PMC4791363_P020,"The Thermocrinis spp. that are abundant in both Octopus and Bechler springs are capable of autotrophy via the reverse TCA carbon fixation pathway and are thought to be the primary producers in streamer filament communities. Accordingly, the other co-occurring streamer community members, including a Pyrobaculum sp. and Ca. Calditenuis aerorheumensis, are predominantly, or strictly heterotrophic. The presence of heterotrophic “Pyropristinus” and Calescamantes-like organisms in these streamer communities provides further evidence for the hypothesis that the dominant Thermocrinis spp. support a diversity of co-occurring heterotrophic streamer community members. Moreover, C isotope studies have shown a mixture of both autotrophy and heterotrophy in streamer communities (including OS spring), and that these community members are capable of responding to transient organic carbon pulses. Thus, the “Pyropristinus” and Calescamantes-like organisms present in the streamer communities are likely utilizing both endogenous and exogenous organic carbon sources for heterotrophic metabolism.",Thermocrinis spp.,Pyrobaculum sp.,support,Mutualism,Thermocrinis,Pyrobaculum,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
PMC4841232_P021,"The fact that the concentration of scopolamine in leaves and seeds are negatively correlated, probably pointing an allocation trade-off, this does not preclude that scopolamine concentration in leaves had a negative effect on the seed predator. Adult females and males of Trichobaris soror courtship, mate, and feed on Datura stramonium leaves. When feeding, adult weevils produce small holes on the leaf blade, and sometimes damage can be severe. Thus, it is likely that Trichobaris soror’s females, while feeding, might “assess” the chemical resistance level of a plant (i.e., atropine/scopolamine concentration in leaves) and select which plants are suitable to oviposit. This would result in lower or null oviposition in those plants with high concentration of scopolamine in leaves. Some evidence in this line shows a close relationship between Trichobaris and Datura. For instance, Trichobaris bridwelli oviposits preferentially on Datura stramonium rather than on tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum), since Trichobaris bridwelli does not tolerate the pyridine alkaloids of tobacco. On the other hand, Diezel, Kessler & Baldwin have experimentally demonstrated that Trichobaris mucorea, a species that burrows into the stems of Nicotiana attenuata, increases infestation on transgenic plants of Nicotiana attenuata where the chemical defenses (jasmonic acid and nicotine) were silenced.",Trichobaris soror,Datura stramonium,feed on,Herbivory,Trichobaris soror,Datura stramonium,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

We considered several hypotheses. (Hypothesis a) Pseudorhabdosynochus sulamericanus was a parasite of the common ancestor of the three grouper species, and the descending parasite species underwent little or no morphological differentiation since the host species were separated; this hypothesis is hampered by the fact that the three groupers, Hyporthodus haifensis, Hyporthodus nigritus and Hyporthodus niveatus, are not sister-species in our phylogenetic analysis. It might be argued, however, that this analysis was based only on COI sequences and that low support was found for several nodes.

PMC4999065_P030,"Higher feeding rates in sites invaded by Artemia franciscana and a concomitant decrease in density of phytoplankton such as Tetraselmis and Dunaliella can have major ramifications. For example, the increase of water clarity can be expected to favour benthic primary producers, mainly dominated by cyanobacteria. Top down effects of Artemia on phytoplankton are supported by the spatial correlation we recorded in the field between chlorophyll-a concentration and Artemia density and biomass (see below; Fig 6). Higher grazing rates by Artemia franciscana are likely to have other consequences on the food web, requiring further study. For example, a change in the rate of filter-feeding on bacteria (or indirect effects on their abundance through modified feeding rates on their competitors) will affect N dynamics and bacterial community structure. These top-down effects can be expected to be strongest in female Artemia franciscana, which consumed algae at higher rates than males, perhaps to compensate for their higher reproductive investment. Given the strong influence of body size on grazing rates (Fig 3), this sexual difference should be even more marked in natural conditions where females can be much bigger than males. Given that Artemia are able to bioaccumulate pollutants, higher grazing rates by the exotic species could also affect the flux of contaminants through the ecosystem.",Artemia franciscana,Dunaliella,graze,Herbivory,Artemia franciscana,Dunaliella,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

The laboratory populations were grown in 40‐L tanks with filtered seawater with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle at 5°C for 137 days, until the F2 generation reached maturity. pH was dynamically controlled using pH computers (Aqua Medic, Germany), applying the CO2 immediately next to the air flow. pH electrodes were placed inside the streams of bubbles. Total scale pH and total alkalinity were measured once a week, using a Metrohm 827 pH meter and by titration of 25 mL water in a SI Analytics Titroline potentiometric titrator, respectively, after which pCO2 was calculated in CO2sys version 1.4. For food, Rhodomonas baltica were pumped intermittently into the tanks to achieve satiating concentrations. Concentrations were measured every two days with an Elzone 5380 electronic particle counter. Water was changed in all tanks every two weeks by siphoning out water from a large 50‐μm sieve inserted into the tanks, then transferring the animals into clean tanks.

We find Florideophyceae mitochondrial genomes to be highly conserved and that gene losses are rare and predominately, if not entirely, observed in genes encoding ribosomal proteins.",Gracilariophila oryzoides,Gracilariopsis andersonii,parasitize,Parasitism,Gracilariophila oryzoides,Gracilariopsis andersonii,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,
PMC5381614_P002,"Metchnikovellidae, a distinct group of Microsporidia with only a few described species, are known exclusively as parasites of gregarines inhabiting the intestinal tract of marine annelids. Spores of metchnikovellids lack some of the main distinguishing ultrastructural features of microsporidians—the coiled polar filament and a stack of membranes termed the polaroplast, which form a complex of organelles for host cell invasion in Microsporidia. The polar filament in metchnikovellid spores is short and straight and is recognized as a rudimentary version of the microsporidian invasion apparatus, delivering sporoplasm to the host cell by eversion in a manner similar to typical microsporidia. Unusual for microsporidians, the life cycle of metchnikovellids lacks merogonial stages—spores are produced by sporogony, often endogenously inside cysts or spore sacs, the size and shape of which serve as a diagnostic trait for classification. The peculiarities of metchnikovellid spore structure and intracellular development have earned them a status of aberrant microsporidians with unclear relationship to the rest of the group. Although metchnikovellids have been known for over a hundred years and are acknowledged for their potential significance to evolutionary studies, the group remains understudied, especially when it comes to molecular data.

PMC5383469_P031,"This suggestion is of special interests for the interactions in our tritrophic system as they can help to understand the evolutionary mechanism behind possible host speciation processes for the beetles. Assuming that the natal Lysimachia parasitoids maintained strongly biased host selection over multiple generations, this high parasitism pressure may have caused Galerucella sagittariae to switch to the lower‐quality Potentilla palustris as an alternative host plant. This alternative explanation could then indicate why the difference in larval performance was not large enough to prevent natal Potentilla beetles from using the lower‐quality Potentilla palustris (Figures 5 and 6), and why natal Potentilla beetles responded to odors from Lysimachia thyrsiflora (Figure 2). For other Galerucella beetles, host race formation has frequently been documented, and such processes would explain our current observations. For further research, it would be of interest to collect long‐term data on host use across generations and whether observed host uses also has resulted in population differentiation. Such data would show if the results found in our study are mainly based on natal experience, or if there are also due to evolutionary changes. Overall, our study suggests that our general knowledge of host use in tritrophic systems can be improved by incorporating information on both host preference and larval performance for all interacting species. Understanding the preference–performance relationships for both the plant host–herbivore and insect host–parasitoid interactions can, consequently, serve as a possible explanation why herbivorous beetles adapt to lower‐quality resources, and help understand how such interaction could possibly lead to host race formation, or sympatric speciation.",Lysimachia parasitoids,Galerucella sagittariae,parasitize,Parasitism,Lysimachia,Galerucella sagittariae,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,

PMC5388311_P001,"The sugar beet root maggot, Tetanops myopaeformis (Röder) (Diptera: Ulidiidae), is an important pest of sugar beet, Beta vulgaris L. (Chenopodiaceae), in the United States and Canada. Larvae feed on roots and root hairs, causing damage that can lead to significant losses in yield of sugar beet roots and allow for secondary infections by pathogens. Management of Tetanops myopaeformis primarily targets larvae in the soil, relying heavily upon the use of carbamate and organophosphate insecticides, both of which have worker safety issues and environmental risks. Moreover, the carbamate insecticide that has been widely used in Idaho for root maggot management (i.e., aldicarb) is scheduled to be phased out of use by 2018, and the remaining organophosphates may be at high risk of removal from registration in relation to ongoing enforcement of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.

However, our analysis represents the first investigation of a vertebrate endosymbiosis where the generalized interaction between the two organisms has consistently been characterized as a mutualism. Our results also extend dual-RNA-seq methodology to low cell number samples from wild collected, non-model organisms.

We estimated RM's and survivorship from a mesocosm experiment which manipulated light, competition, and predation on three anuran species representing a continuum of RM's: Anaxyrus americanus (RM = 1/10), Hyla versicolor, Lithobates sphenocephalus. Briefly, each species was raised in replicated 1000-L mesocosms either alone (single-species), with all three anuran species together (competition treatment), or all three anuran species and caudate predators (competition + predation treatment). All of these treatments were crossed with 2 light levels: high (77% of ambient) and low (27% of ambient) light. Anuran larvae were removed from the mesocosms upon metamorphosis, measured and weighed (wet mass in g). A subset from each species were subsequently measured for dry mass to create species-specific wet mass to dry mass conversion rates for the experiment (Anaxyrus americanus: 0.113, Hyla versicolor: 0.143, and Lithobates sphenocephalus: 0.149).

We individually ringed juveniles and adults of two recently speciated sympatric sibling species of insectivorous bats and monitored their reproductive parameters and dispersal with the objective to evaluate whether subtle species‐specific ecological differences translate into distinct life‐history adjustments. These two bat species share common nursery roosts in their wide area of sympatry, where they coexist in a stable way. This is possible thanks to a clear‐cut niche resource partitioning mechanism along the foraging habitat and diet axes although the two species behave as generalist predators. One species, the greater mouse‐eared bat Myotis myotis exploits primarily ground‐dwelling invertebrates, mostly carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) that occur as fully grown adults at a fairly constant rate from early spring until the onset of hibernation. Its food supply appears thus fairly predictable. In contrast, its sister taxon, the lesser mouse‐eared bat Myotis blythii relies on bush crickets (Saltatoria, Tettigoniidae). Bush crickets are a profitable prey when they reach adult body size, that is, from late spring or early summer onward, but are not in early spring. The two bat species thus usually face marked seasonal differences in food supply in spite of their great similarity in morphology, foraging, and roosting behavior. The delayed availability of the main food source of the lesser mouse‐eared bat (bush crickets), that is, the lower food supply it usually experiences in early spring, results in a median delay in parturition of approximately 10 days compared to the greater mouse‐eared bat. Such a temporal difference may have an impact on the age at first reproduction because mating in both species takes place in late summer, with late‐born pups being unlikely to reach sexual maturity as yearlings. Thus, the lesser mouse‐eared bat is more likely to have delayed sexual maturation compared to the greater mouse‐eared bat. Yet, the interspecific difference in parturition times disappears in years with massive occurrence of cockchafers Melolontha melolontha Fabricius 1775, which takes place every third or fourth year from late April to early June in the study area. In such years, cockchafers are a superabundant, though temporary food resource for both species. Cockchafers thus represent a typical pulse resource, as described for various ecosystems and taxa.
